## Troubleshooting

### Common Error Messages

#### "Target machine already has a license"

The target computer already has an active license. Migration only works to computers without existing licenses.

You can only migrate 5 times per month. Wait until next month or contact support.

#### "Invalid machine ID format"

Ensure you copied the complete Machine ID correctly. It should be at least 10 characters long.

Check that:

- Your current license is active and not expired
