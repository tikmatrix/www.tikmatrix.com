# Connect to CloudPhone

This guide will help you connect to a GeeLark CloudPhone using TikZenX.

You can purchase a CloudPhone from [GeeLark](https://www.geelark.cn?invite_code=XHY6a8).

## Enable ADB

Enable ADB in the desired CloudPhone profile from the Profiles section.

You can also enable ADB for multiple profiles at once.

## Start the Profile

After opening the profile, click the ðŸ”— icon to get the IP address, port, and connection code for the CloudPhone.

## Run ADB Commands

1. Click `Settings` > `Open ADB Terminal` in TikZenX.
2. Run `adb connect <IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>` and check if your phone appears in the list with status `device`.
3. Run `adb -s <IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT> shell glogin <CONNECTION_CODE>` to authenticate the connection.

> For example, if your IP address is `1.2.3.4` and your port is `5555` and the connection code is `f850ef`, the command would look like this:
>
> ```shell
> adb connect 1.2.3.4:5555
> adb -s 1.2.3.4:5555 shell glogin f850ef
> ```

## Final Steps

Open TikZenX and wait for the CloudPhone to appear in the device list. If it doesn't show up immediately, try refreshing the device list.

Congratulations! You are now connected to your CloudPhone and can manage it like any other Android device in TikZenX.
