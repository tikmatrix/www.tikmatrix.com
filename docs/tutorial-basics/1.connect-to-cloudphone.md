# Connect to CloudPhone

This guide will help you connect to a GeeLark CloudPhone using TikMatrix.

You can purchase a CloudPhone from [GeeLark](https://www.geelark.cn?invite_code=XHY6a8).

## Enable ADB

Enable ADB in the desired CloudPhone profile from the Profiles section.

## Start the Profile

After opening the profile, click the 🔗 icon to get the IP address, port, and connection code for the CloudPhone.

## Run ADB Commands

1. Click `Settings` > `Open ADB Terminal` in TikMatrix.
2. Run the connection command based on your operating system and check if your phone appears in the list with status `device`.
3. Run the authentication command to authenticate the connection.

### For Windows systems

```shell
.\adb.exe connect <IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>
.\adb.exe -s <IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT> shell glogin <CONNECTION_CODE>
```

### For Mac/Linux systems

```shell
./adb connect <IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>
./adb -s <IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT> shell glogin <CONNECTION_CODE>
```

> For example, if your IP address is `1.2.3.4` and your port is `5555` and the connection code is `f850ef`
>
> **Windows:**
>
> ```shell
> .\adb.exe connect 1.2.3.4:5555
> .\adb.exe -s 1.2.3.4:5555 shell glogin f850ef
> ```
>
> **Mac/Linux:**
>
> ```shell
> ./adb connect 1.2.3.4:5555
> ./adb -s 1.2.3.4:5555 shell glogin f850ef
> ```

## Final Steps

Open TikMatrix and wait for the CloudPhone to appear in the device list. If it doesn't show up immediately, try refreshing the device list.

Congratulations! You are now connected to your CloudPhone and can manage it like any other Android device in TikMatrix.
