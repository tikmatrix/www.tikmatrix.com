# Screen Cast Settings

TikMatrix provides a small-screen and a big-screen casting mode and several options to tune image quality, on-screen size and behaviour. This page explains each option available in the Screen Cast Settings dialog.

## Small Screen Resolution

Small screen resolution controls the quality of the device view inside a single device card on the grid. Lower values use less CPU and bandwidth, higher values improve clarity.

Available presets:

- Very Low (240)
- Ultra Low (360)
- Low (480)
- Standard (720)

Choose a lower value if you run many devices on one machine or suffer from lag. Choosing a higher value may improve legibility for text and UI elements but consumes more resources.

## Big Screen Resolution

Big screen resolution applies when you open a device in Big Screen mode (a larger floating window). It has its own set of presets to allow a higher quality view on stronger machines.

Available presets:

- Ultra Low (360)
- Low (480)
- Standard (720)
- High (1080)

If you regularly open a single device in Big Screen and want a crisp view, choose 720 or 1080. For low-end hosts, prefer 360 or 480.

## Screen Size (Grid Card Size)

The Screen Size control adjusts the on-screen size of the small device view inside the grid. This setting only changes the rendering size on the computer — it does not change the real phone's screen resolution.

- Use the minus/plus buttons to decrease/increase the small screen card size.
- The numeric value represents pixels used for the card height and is clamped to sensible ranges to avoid extremely large or tiny cards.

## Big Screen Mode

Choose how Big Screen behaves:

- Standard Window — opens the device in a separate floating window.
- Docked Window — keeps the device shown docked inside the device grid (useful when you want it visible while keeping the grid layout).

Use `Docked` when you prefer devices to stay within the grid and `Standard` when you want a free-floating large view.

## Screen-Off Cast

When enabled, the phone's screen will be turned off while casting. This saves battery, reduces device heat, and often improves stability for real-device casting.

Notes:

- This feature only affects the physical device screen — it does not change the image sent to the computer; the computer still receives the cast stream.
- Some devices or ROMs may not fully support screen-off behaviour; test on a sample device before applying at scale.

## Tips and Recommendations

- For large farms, prefer smaller small-screen resolutions (360 or 480) to reduce CPU and bandwidth per device.
- Use High (1080) for demo or inspection work where one device needs to be inspected closely.
- If you see streaming instability when switching resolutions, try toggling hibernate casting off, then back on, or restart the scrcpy session for that device.

## Where to find this dialog

Open the Devices page, then click the Screen Cast Settings icon (desktop/monitor icon) to open the dialog and change these values.
