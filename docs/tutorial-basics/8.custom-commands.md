# Custom ADB Commands

TikZenX allows you to create and manage custom ADB commands for quick execution of common operations, streamlining your workflow and improving efficiency.

## What Are Custom ADB Commands?

Custom ADB commands let you save frequently used ADB instructions and execute them with a single click, eliminating the need to manually enter commands each time.

## Accessing the Custom Commands Interface

1. In the TikZenX main interface, click **Custom Commands** in the left sidebar.
2. The interface displays all your saved commands, with options to add or reset commands.

## Preset Commands

TikZenX provides several useful preset commands:

- **Home**: Return to the device home screen
- **Back**: Perform a back operation
- **Enable TCP**: Enable TCP/IP connection mode
- **Enable Fast Input**: Enable the fast input method
- **Open Gallery**: Open the device gallery
- **Open Settings**: Open device settings
- **Open NekoBox**: Open the NekoBox app (if installed)

## Adding Custom Commands

1. Click **Add Command** at the top of the interface.
2. In the dialog, fill in:
   - **Command Name**: A recognizable name for your command
   - **Command Arguments**: The ADB command parameters (no need to include the "adb" prefix)
3. Click **Add Command** to save.

## Multi-line Command Support

Custom commands support multi-line input; each line is treated as a separate ADB command and executed in sequence.
