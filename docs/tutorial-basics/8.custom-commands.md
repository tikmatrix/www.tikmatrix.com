# Custom ADB Commands

TikMatrix allows you to create and manage custom ADB commands to quickly execute common operations. These commands can simplify your workflow and improve operational efficiency.

## What are Custom ADB Commands

The custom ADB command feature lets you save frequently used ADB instructions and execute them with a simple click, eliminating the need to manually enter complete commands each time.

## Accessing the Custom Commands Interface

1. In the TikMatrix main interface, find and click on the **Custom Commands** option in the left sidebar.
2. The custom commands interface will display all your saved commands, along with buttons to add new commands and reset commands.

## Preset Commands

When you first use the feature, TikMatrix has already prepared some useful preset commands:

- **Home**: Return to the device home screen
- **Back**: Perform a back operation
- **Enable TCP**: Enable TCP/IP connection mode
- **Enable Fast Input**: Enable the fast input method
- **Open Gallery**: Open the device gallery
- **Open Settings**: Open device settings
- **Open NekoBox**: Open the NekoBox app (if installed)

## Adding Custom Commands

1. Click the **Add Command** button at the top of the interface.
2. In the popup dialog, fill in the following information:
   - **Command Name**: Give your command an easily recognizable name
   - **Command Arguments**: Enter the ADB command parameters (no need to include the "adb" prefix)
3. Click the **Add Command** button to save.

## Support for Multi-line Commands

Custom commands support multi-line input, with each line treated as a separate ADB command and executed in sequence.
