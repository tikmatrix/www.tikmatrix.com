    ```shell
    bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MHSanaei/3x-ui/refs/tags/v2.6.0/install.sh)
    # Follow the prompts to complete the VPN setup.
    ```

3. After installation, access the x-ui web interface. You can find the URL and login credentials in the terminal output after installation.
4. Create a new user in x-ui, set the protocol to `SOCKS5`, and configure the port and other settings as needed.
5. After creating the user, you will see the proxy IP and port in the x-ui interface.
6. Use the proxy IP and port in the NekoBox app on your phone.

### For Chinese Users

If you are in China, the `SOCKS5` protocol may not work well. You need add a encryption proxy(`VLESS`) as the frontend proxy. You can use the following tools:

1. Add a `VLESS` proxy in the NekoBox app.
2. Add a `SOCKS5` proxy in the NekoBox app.
3. Add a `Chain` proxy in the NekoBox app. And select the `VLESS` proxy as the frontend proxy and the `SOCKS5` proxy as the backend proxy.
