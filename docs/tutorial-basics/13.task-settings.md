# Task Settings

## Task scheduling rules

- Tasks scheduled to start will be executed within 10 seconds of their start time.
- Each device runs only one task at a time; additional tasks are automatically queued per device.
- Maximum concurrent tasks are limited by the license tier; free users will not run automated tasks and will remain in a "Waiting" state.
- Before each retry, the system applies a randomized delay between 5 and 60 seconds.

This dialog lets you control how tasks are retried and the execution order used by devices. Below are the options and how to use them.

## Auto Retry

What it does:

- Automatically retries a failed task until it succeeds or reaches the retry limit.

How to use:

- Enable when failures are often transient (network hiccups, temporary app issues).
- Test on a small set of tasks before enabling globally.

## Max Retry Count

What it does:

- Sets the maximum number of automatic retry attempts for a failed task.

How to use:

- Choose a conservative value (2–3) to avoid long retry loops, or raise it when transient failures are frequent.
- UI enforces sensible bounds (e.g., 1–10).

## Random Order

What it does:

- Executes tasks in a randomized sequence per device to reduce synchronized behaviour.

How to use:

- Enable for large device pools or when you want less predictable task patterns.

## Applying changes

- Changes apply immediately; the dialog shows success or error notifications.

## Where to find it

- Open the Devices or Tasks page and click the Task Settings (gear) icon.

## Quick tips

- Start with `Max Retry Count` = 2–3 and adjust based on observed failures.
- Use `Random Order` to make large-scale runs appear more natural.
- Verify `Auto Retry` on a small sample before broad use.
