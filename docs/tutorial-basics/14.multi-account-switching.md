# Multi-Account Switching

TikTok and Instagram both support logging in multiple accounts on the same device—this is a native feature of the official apps. TikMatrix and IgMatrix provide automated account switching so you can run tasks across all logged-in accounts without manual intervention.

## Supported scripts

The following scripts support automatic account switching:

- **Profile** — View account profile information
- **Account Warmup** — Warm up accounts with natural activity
- **Post** — Publish posts
- **Mass DM** — Send direct messages in bulk
- **Follow Back** — Follow back users who follow you
- **Unfollow All** — Unfollow all accounts
- **Delete Post** — Remove published posts
- **Boost Users** — Increase engagement with user profiles
- **Boost Posts** — Increase engagement with posts
- **Boost Lives** — Increase engagement with live streams
- **Mass Comment** — Post comments in bulk
- **Boost Comments** — Increase engagement with comments
- **Super Marketing** — Advanced marketing automation

## Initial setup: Match Accounts

Before using the multi-account switching feature, you must first match accounts from your device.

1. Open the **Scripts** tab in the left navigation.
2. Find and run the **Match Accounts** script.
3. This script scans the device for logged-in accounts and automatically adds them to your account list.
4. After the script completes, click the **Accounts** button to verify that your device accounts were added successfully.

## Testing account switching

After running **Match Accounts**, you can test the account switching functionality:

1. Run the **Switch Account** script from the Scripts tab.
2. This script has no other logic—it simply validates that the account switching flow works correctly.
3. If the script succeeds, the account switching feature is ready to use.

## Using multi-account mode

Once you've completed the initial setup and testing:

1. When running any supported script, enable **Multi-Account Mode** in the script settings.
2. The system will create independent tasks for each account in your account list.
3. Tasks are queued and executed sequentially—the system automatically switches to the target account and runs the automation.
4. No manual intervention is required.

## When to re-run Match Accounts

The **Match Accounts** and **Switch Account** scripts typically only need to be run once during initial setup. However, you should re-run **Match Accounts** if:

- You log in new accounts on the device
- You log out existing accounts
- Accounts on the device have changed

To refresh the account list:

1. Manually clear the account list in the **Accounts** section.
2. Re-run the **Match Accounts** script to detect the current accounts on the device.

Multi-account switching eliminates the need to manually switch between accounts, making it easy to scale your automation across all accounts on a single device.
