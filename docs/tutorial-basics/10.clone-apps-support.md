# Clone App Support

TikMatrix and IgMatrix support running multiple clone apps (such as GB TikTok, GB Instagram, Instagram Plus, or other modified versions) on the same device, each with its own package name. This feature enables you to manage multiple accounts more efficiently by using different app instances.

:::danger Risk Warning
Using clone apps may violate TikTok/Instagram's Terms of Service and could result in account suspension or ban. We only provide technical support for this feature and are **NOT responsible** for any account-related issues, including bans, suspensions, or restrictions caused by using clone apps. Use at your own risk.
:::

## What is a Package Name?

Every Android app has a unique identifier called a **package name**. The official apps use standard package names:

- TikTok: `com.zhiliaoapp.musically`
- Instagram: `com.instagram.android`

Clone apps use different package names like:

- GB TikTok: `com.zhiliaoapp.musically.gb`
- GB Instagram: `com.instagram.gb.android`
- Instagram Plus: `com.instagram.plus.android`

TikMatrix/IgMatrix can automatically detect and use the correct package name for each account.

## Setting Up Clone Apps

### Step 1: Install Clone Apps

1. Install your preferred clone app(s) on your device or CloudPhone.
2. Make sure each clone app has a unique package name to avoid conflicts.
3. Log in to different accounts in each app instance.

### Step 2: Configure Package Names

You have two options to configure package names:

#### Option A: Account-Level Configuration (Recommended)

Set a specific package name for each account:

1. Open **Accounts** in the left navigation.
2. Click on an account to edit it, or click **Add** to create a new one.
3. In the **Package Name** field, you can:
   - **Manually enter** the clone app's package name (e.g., `com.instagram.gb.android`)
   - **Auto-detect** by clicking the **Detect Package** button (requires device selection first)
4. Click **Save**.

:::tip Auto-Detect Package Name
The **Detect Package** button automatically detects the currently opened app on the selected device. This is the easiest way to get the correct package name:

1. Select a device for the account
2. Open the clone app on that device
3. Click the **Detect Package** button
4. The package name will be automatically filled in

This feature works with any Android app, including TikTok/Instagram clones, App Cloner apps, and NomixCloner apps.

When you run scripts for this account, TikMatrix/IgMatrix will automatically use the specified package name.

#### Option B: System-Wide Default

Set a default package name for all accounts that don't have a specific one:

1. Open **Settings** in the left navigation.
2. Find the **TikTok Package Name** or **Instagram Package Name** field.
3. Enter the default package name.
4. Click **Save**.

:::tip Priority
Account-level settings always override the system-wide default. If an account has its own package name configured, that will be used instead of the default.
:::

## How It Works

When you run any automation script:

1. TikMatrix/IgMatrix checks if the target account has a custom package name configured.
2. If yes, it uses that package name for all UI automation operations.
3. If no, it falls back to the system-wide default package name.
4. All resource IDs and XPath queries are automatically formatted with the correct package name.

## Supported Scripts

The following scripts fully support dynamic package names:

**TikMatrix Scripts:**

- Login
- Profile Editing
- Post Creation
- Account Warmup
- Mass DM
- Super Boost
- All other automation features

**IgMatrix Scripts:**

- Post Creation
- Account Warmup
- Super Boost
- Boost Posts
- Mass DM
- Match Accounts
- All other automation features

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Usernames

Since you may have multiple accounts in different clone apps, use descriptive usernames to identify which app each account belongs to:

```text
username_gb      → GB TikTok/Instagram
username_plus    → TikTok/Instagram Plus
username         → Official App
```

### 2. Organize Accounts by Groups

Create device groups based on the clone app type:

- **Group A**: All accounts using GB apps
- **Group B**: All accounts using Plus apps
- **Group C**: All accounts using official apps

### 3. Test Before Mass Operations

Before running scripts on all accounts:

1. Test with a single account first
2. Verify the correct app is being used
3. Confirm all operations work as expected

### 4. Keep Package Names Consistent

Once you set a package name for an account, don't change it unless you switch to a different clone app. Consistency helps avoid confusion and errors.

## Troubleshooting

### Script Opens Wrong App

**Problem**: The script opens the wrong app instead of the clone app.

**Solution**:

1. Check the account's **Package Name** field is correctly set
2. Verify the clone app is installed and the package name matches
3. Use the **Detect Package** button to automatically get the correct package name
4. Restart the device if the app was recently installed

### Can't Find UI Elements

**Problem**: Script reports "element not found" errors.

**Solution**:

1. Different clone apps may have slightly different UI layouts
2. Check if the clone app version is compatible
3. Try updating to the latest version of TikMatrix/IgMatrix
4. Contact support if the issue persists

### Multiple Accounts in Same App

**Problem**: Want to switch between multiple accounts in the same app instance.

**Solution**:

- TikTok/Instagram supports multiple logged-in accounts natively
- Use the **Switch Account** feature in TikMatrix/IgMatrix
- Set the same package name for all accounts in that app instance
- TikMatrix/IgMatrix will handle account switching automatically

### Detect Package Button Not Working

**Problem**: The **Detect Package** button doesn't work or shows an error.

**Solution**:

1. Make sure you have selected a device first
2. Ensure the app is currently open on the device
3. Check the device connection is stable
4. Try opening the app again and click detect

## Finding Package Names

If you want to manually check package names on your device:

### Using ADB Command

```bash
# List all TikTok-related packages
adb shell pm list packages | grep musically

# List all Instagram-related packages
adb shell pm list packages | grep instagram
```

### Using Auto-Detect Feature

The easiest way is to use the built-in **Detect Package** button:

1. Open the account edit dialog
2. Select the device
3. Open the clone app on the device
4. Click **Detect Package**
5. The package name will be automatically detected and filled in

This method works for any Android app and is the recommended approach.
