# Initialize Devices

The TikZenX APK is a mobile agent required for automation tasks. **When you connect your phone to TikZenX for the first time, the system will automatically initialize your device and install the TikZenX app** - no manual intervention is required.

During the automatic initialization process, TikZenX will install two APK files: TikZenX and TikZenX Test (no interface). If your phone prompts for installation authorization, simply tap "Allow" (especially important on Xiaomi devices).

## Automatic vs Manual Installation

**Automatic Installation (Recommended)**: By default, TikZenX automatically initializes devices when they are first connected. This is the easiest and most convenient method.

**Manual Installation/Update**: Only needed in special cases or for updates.

## Automatic Initialization Process

When you connect a new device to TikZenX:

1. **Device Detection**: TikZenX automatically detects the connected device.
2. **Automatic Installation**: The system will automatically install the TikZenX app without user intervention.
3. **Authorization**: If your device prompts for installation permission, simply tap "Allow".
4. **Completion**: The initialization process completes in about 10 seconds.
5. **Ready to Use**: Your device is now ready for automation tasks.

This automatic process eliminates the need for manual setup in most cases.

## Manual Installation/Update

To manually install or update the TikZenX APK, turn off the `Auto WakeUP Agent` switch in Settings. Then follow these steps:

1. Select your phone and click `General` > `Init Agent`.
2. TikZenX will automatically install both APK files on your phone.
3. If prompted, tap "Allow" to authorize installation.
4. If blocked by Google Play Protect, tap "Install anyway" to continue.
5. Wait for installation to complete (about 10 seconds).
6. Turn on the `Auto WakeUP Agent` switch to enable automatic app wake-up when the phone is connected.
7. Click `General` > `Open Agent` to test the installation. If the app fails to start, contact technical support.
