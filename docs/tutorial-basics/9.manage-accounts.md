# Account Management

Account management keeps every TikTok or Instagram identity in sync with the devices they run on, the credentials they need, and the data your automation depends on. A clean account list makes it easy to delegate devices, monitor account health, and prepare campaigns without touching each phone manually.

## Create an account manually

1. Open **Accounts** in the left navigation.
2. Click **Add** to open the editor dialog.
3. Fill in the basic fields:
   - **Email**: the address used by the app. TikMatrix/IgMatrix first attempts an email + password login; if the email is blank, it automatically falls back to username + password.
   - **Password**: the credential used on the app. IgMatrix also accepts a password extended with a 2FA secret (see below).
   - **Username** â€” the handle shown in TikTok/Instagram. This is the only required field.
   - Toggle **Login Status** to mark whether the app session is already authenticated on the device (1 = Logged in, 0 = Not logged in).
   - Toggle **Status** to keep the account active (0 = Enabled) or disable it (1 = Disabled).
4. Pick a device badge to bind the account to a phone or CloudPhone. If no device is selected, the account stays unassigned.
5. Click **Save**. The list refreshes automatically.

## Login

- When both **Email** and **Password** are provided, TikMatrix/IgMatrix will log in with that pair on the assigned device.
- If the **Email** field is empty, it will try the **Username** + **Password** combination instead.
- Make sure a device index is selected so the login script knows where to run.
- The login automation detects already authenticated sessions and skips them automatically.

## 2FA support (IgMatrix only)

IgMatrix can handle two-factor authentication during automated logins.

### 2FA password format

To enable 2FA, store the password in the following format:

```text
your_password:your_2fa_secret
```

**Example:**

```text
mypassword123:JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP
```

## Importing and exporting accounts

- **Export** writes every account to `accounts.xlsx` in your TikMatrix/IgMatrix download folder. Use this as a living backup or as the template for bulk edits.
- **Import** lets you bulk create or update accounts from that Excel sheet. If you are unsure about the header format, click **Export** first, edit the downloaded file, and then import it back.
- During import, any row that contains an `id` updates the existing record. Rows without `id` create new accounts.

> For IgMatrix 2FA logins, populate `username`, `pwd` (using the `password:2fa_secret` format), and the `device_index` column.

### Excel column reference

| Column | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | No | Internal identifier. Include it only when you intend to update an existing account. |
| `email` | No | Login email used by the app. Helpful for contact and recovery. |
| `pwd` | No | Stored password for quick reference or automated logins. |
| `username` | Yes | TikTok/Instagram handle. Must be unique within the workspace. |
| `device` | No | Device serial or CloudPhone identifier bound to the account. |
| `device_index` | No | Friendly device label shown in the UI; mainly for reference. |
| `logined` | No | Session flag (`1` = logged in, `0` = not logged in). |
| `status` | No | Availability flag (`0` = enabled, `1` = disabled). Disabled accounts never join script runs. |
| `nickname` | No | Latest nickname retrieved from TikTok data sync. |
| `country` | No | Country inferred from the TikTok profile. |
| `followers` | No | Number of followers synced from TikTok. |
| `following` | No | Number of accounts this profile follows. |
| `hearts` | No | Total likes (hearts) on the profile. |
| `videos` | No | Published video count. |
| `friends` | No | Mutual friend count when available. |

### TikMatrix vs. IgMatrix fields

- **TikMatrix** populates the statistics fields (`nickname`, `country`, `followers`, `following`, `hearts`, `videos`, `friends`) after you run **Sync TikTok Data** or use the data query button.
- **IgMatrix** uses only the basic columns (`email`, `pwd`, `username`, `device`, `logined`, `status`) and ignores the analytics columns.

## Additional behaviors

- Accounts marked as **Disabled** are excluded from every automation script, scheduled task, and bulk action. Re-enable them before launching new jobs.
- The **Match Accounts** script scans devices for app sessions that are already logged in, automatically creates the corresponding entries in the account list, and links them to the detected device. This is the fastest way to onboard phones that were prepared manually.
