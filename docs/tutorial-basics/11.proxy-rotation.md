# Easy Proxy Rotation Guide

Proxy rotation helps TikMatrix automatically change the IP address that a phone uses. Use it when you want a clean network before logging in, switching accounts, or running sensitive tasks.

## What you need

- A proxy service that supports “rotate IP” or “change IP” by clicking a link or calling a simple URL.
- The proxy rotation link (sometimes called *rotation URL*, *refresh URL*, or *change IP URL*).
- Optional: any password or token that your proxy provider requires.

## Save the rotation link for a device

1. Open **Manage Devices** in the TikMatrix desktop app and switch to the table view.
2. Find the device you want to control and click **Configure** in the *Proxy rotation URL* column.
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Proxy rotation URL**: paste the link from your proxy provider. TikMatrix will open this link every time it needs a new IP.
   - **Request method**: keep `GET` unless your provider explicitly tells you to use `POST`.
   - **Headers** and **Body**: leave them empty unless your provider gives you a short example that uses them. If needed, copy their example into the box exactly as they show it.
   - **Timeout**: how long TikMatrix waits for the proxy service to answer. The default 10 seconds works for most services.
4. Click **Save**. TikMatrix stores everything automatically—you do not need to edit any files.

After saving, the table shows the last rotation result next to the device. A green label means the last rotation succeeded, a gray label means it has not run yet, and a red label means the proxy service returned an error.

## Check that the link works

1. Stay on the same table row and click **Test Proxy Rotation**.
2. TikMatrix will call the link immediately.  
   - If it works, you will see a success message and the “Last rotated” time will update.  
   - If it fails, note the message, double-check the link and any passwords, then try again.

Tip: many proxy providers limit how often you can rotate. If the test fails, wait a few seconds and try again.

## Use proxy rotation during scripts

1. When running the script, first check **Proxy Rotation**. TikMatrix will then change the IP for each device one by one before opening TikTok.  
2. You can click the log button on the right side of each device to view detailed information about each rotation.

## Common questions

- **Do I need to rotate for every script?** No. Use it when you want TikTok to see a fresh IP—for example, before switching between many accounts.
- **Where are the settings stored?** TikMatrix handles the storage. You only need to fill out the form once per device.
- **The provider link looks complicated. Will it still work?** Yes. As long as the link comes from your provider and works in a browser, TikMatrix can open it too.
- **Who can help if it still fails?** Send the provider’s instructions and any error message to TikMatrix support so we can review them together.
