### Tips

* The procedure may vary from brand to brand, but basically it's pretty much the same.
* If there is no response, please try to replace the data cable or the USB port behind the computer.

## How to Connect the Motherboard or Case

1. Request the authorization files `adbkey` and `adbkey.pub` from the seller of your motherboard or case.
2. Copy the authorization files to the `C:\Users\YourComputerUsername\.android` directory on your computer.
3. Restart your computer.

### Tip 2

* Please make sure to back up these two authorization files properly, as you will need them again if you reinstall the system or switch to a new computer.
* If these two files are lost, you will need to touch the phone screen to allow permission.
