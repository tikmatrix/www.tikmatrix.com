# Auto Posting

Auto Posting is a feature that allows you to automatically post videos or images to TikTok at a specific time. You can set the caption, tags, and video/image with recommended sound and product link for the post.

## Setting up a Posting Job

Before creating a posting task, you need to complete [Create Group](create-a-group) and [Bind Account](create-a-account), otherwise, it will prompt that 0 tasks have been created.

1. Click the `Publish Settings` button of the group.
2. If you want to post a video at a specific time, turn on the `Auto Publishing` switch, configure the time to start the posting task (`hour:minute`), this time is the time of the computer. (Not recommended to enable this feature for the first test)
3. Select the type of post, support video and image (you can set the number of images).
4. Choose whether to add TikTok recommended music (you can customize the volume of the original sound and recommended music).
5. Choose whether to add a product link. (If enabled, the first product link in the storefront will be automatically added when posting the video)
6. Fill in the title and tags. The format is `Title#Tag1#Tag2#Tag3`.
7. Click the `Save` button.
8. Click the `Materials` button to upload videos or images. If you want to set a separate title and tags for each material, click the `Edit Title` button of the material.
