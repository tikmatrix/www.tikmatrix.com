# Scrape Users

The Scrape Users script is used to scrape TikTok usernames. The user scraping feature supports three modes: collecting the followers list of a specified user, collecting the following list of a specified user, or collecting users by searching with keywords.

## Steps

1. Select the device to run the script. If you select multiple devices, the scraping tasks will be evenly distributed among the selected devices.
2. Click `Script` > `Scrape Users`.
3. Configure the task settings:
    - **Scrape Mode**: Select the mode for scraping users.
      - **Scrape by Followers**: Collect users from the followers list of specified accounts.
      - **Scrape by Following**: Collect users from the following list of specified accounts.
      - **Scrape by Keyword**: Search and collect users using keywords.
    - **Target Account Usernames**: Enter the username of the account to scrape users from, one per line (for Followers and Following modes).
    - **Search Keywords**: Enter keywords to search for users (for Keyword mode).
    - **Max scrape count**: Set the maximum number of users to scrape.

4. Click `Start Script` to begin.

## Note

- The scraped user data will be saved to a file based on the scraping mode:
- For Followers mode: `exported_users_following_tiktok_<username>_<count>.txt`
- For Following mode: `exported_users_followers_tiktok_<username>_<count>.txt`
- For Keyword mode: `exported_users_search_tiktok_<keyword>_<count>.txt`
- TikTok only limits the number of users that can be viewed, so only about 50 records can be retrieved per operation.
