# Post

Post script is used to publish videos or images to TikTok.

## Steps

1. Click the `Material Library` button to upload videos/images to the material library.
2. Select the device to publish.
3. Click the `Script` - `Post` button.
4. Configure the publish settings: caption, tags, video/image, sound, and product link.
5. Click the `Start Script` button to start the post.

## Material Tags

You can add tags to materials. When creating a post task, you can choose to use materials with specific tags. If no tag is specified, all materials in the material library will be used.

## Material Caption

You can specify a custom caption for each material. When posting, the material's custom caption will be used first. If no custom caption is specified, a random caption from the post settings will be used.

## Material Username

You can specify a custom username for each material. When posting, materials matching the username will be used first, followed by other materials that meet the criteria.

## Material Order

You can configure the order number for materials, which is effective when posting multiple images. The smaller the number, the earlier it appears. For example (1,2,3).

## Note

* The post script is not 100% successful, you may need retry the failed tasks.
* You can also turn on the schedule post to create post tasks automatically at a specific time.
* Tasks will be failed if there are no enough materials in the material library.
