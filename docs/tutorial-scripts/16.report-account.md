# Report Account

:::warning Responsible Use
Reporting accounts is a powerful action. Use the report feature only for legitimate violations (fraud, scams, spam, etc.). Misuse may result in account restrictions or other adverse effects.
:::

The Report Account guide explains how to use the built-in report capability exposed by the Super Marketing script. The feature automates the fixed in-app report flow to help process a list of user accounts, but it does not support customizing the report path or reporting reasons beyond the fixed selection described below.

## Quick overview

- The reporting flow used by the scripts is fixed and cannot be changed in the UI or scripts:

```txt
Report → Report account → Something else → Frauds and scams
```

- The script attempts to navigate the user's profile, open the report menu, choose the fixed path above, and submit the report when possible.
- Because mobile UI differs between app versions and devices, the script uses best-effort UI selectors; always test on a small batch first.

## Steps to run (via Super Marketing)

1. Open TikMatrix/IgMatrix and select the device(s) to run on (multi-select supported).
2. Open `Scripts` → `Super Marketing`.
3. Set **Data source** to `Usernames` and import a text file or paste usernames (one per line). After import choose `Append` or `Overwrite`.
4. In **User Actions**, enable **Report account** (the new toggle) and verify the displayed fixed report path.
5. Configure task concurrency, delays and other task settings as needed.
6. Click `Start Script` to begin processing the list. Monitor logs and device screens for success/fail feedback.

## Tips and recommendations

- Test with 1–5 accounts first to confirm the report UI is detected and the sequence works on your target app version and devices.
- Keep conservative pacing and delays; heavy automated reporting can trigger platform defenses or rate limits.
- This feature uses a fixed in-app path. If the app UI changes (text or element positions), the automation may fail until selectors are updated.
- Do not use reporting to harass or target innocent users. Only report clear violations consistent with the platform's terms.
- Review logs after a run; the script will log failures such as missing menu buttons or missing report options so you can adjust timing or selectors.

## When not to use

- If you need to select custom report reasons or submit detailed evidence per-case — the script does not support that level of customization.
- For legal or sensitive matters where manual review is required.

## Troubleshooting

- "Could not find Report option" / "Could not find 'Report account' option": the UI text or layout likely changed. Re-run with a small test set and capture device screenshots for debugging.
- If reports are being submitted but have no effect, the platform may ignore automated reports or apply moderation rules. Consider manual review for critical cases.
