# Profile

Profile script is used to set the profile of the account.

## Steps

1. Select the device to set the profile.
2. Click the `Tk Toolbox` - `Start FillProfile` button.
3. Enter the profile information: Nickname, Username, Bio, Avatar.
4. Click the `Start Script` button to begin the Profile task.

## Note

* It's better to clear the gallery before setting the profile, because the script will use the first photo in the gallery as the avatar.
