# Profile

The Profile script is used to set up account profiles.

## Steps

1. Select the device to run the script.
2. Click `Script` > `Fill Profile`.
3. Configure the task settings:
    - **Nicknames**: One nickname per line. A random nickname is selected for each task.
    - **Usernames**: One username per line. A random username is selected for each task.
    - **Bios**: One bio per line (supports mentioning users and line breaks). A random bio is selected for each task.
      - To add line breaks in bio, use `\n` in your text. For example: `First line\nSecond line\nThird line`
    - **Avatar Path**: File path to the avatar image. A random path is selected for each task.
4. Click `Start Script` to begin.

## Note

- It is recommended to clear the gallery before setting the profile, as the script uses the first photo as the avatar.
