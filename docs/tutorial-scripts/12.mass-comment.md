# Mass Comment

:::warning
This feature has been merged into the [Super Marketing script](./14.super-marketing.md). Please prefer Super Marketing for more powerful and flexible bulk commenting and engagement capabilities.
:::

Mass Comment is used to post engagement replies across many TikTok posts—useful for account nurturing, promotions, or activity boosting. The system supports both pre-generated templates and real-time generation, and it attempts to mimic human-like timing to reduce detection risk.

## Using Mass Comment inside Super Marketing

1. Open the Super Marketing script.
2. Select the data source type: "Post URL list".
3. Paste post URLs in bulk or import a `.txt` file (one URL per line). After import you can choose to "Append" or "Replace" the current list.
4. Choose a data usage strategy:

   - Shared pool: all bot accounts will comment from the same target pool.

   - Single-consumption: each bot account processes different targets so each post receives a comment from only one account.

5. Set how many comments to post per target (usually 1 to avoid duplicate comments).
6. Configure comment settings:

   - Pre-generated templates: paste multiple lines or paragraphs of prepared comment copy. Each line/paragraph is treated as a candidate comment.

   - Comment order: choose "Random" or "Sequential".

   - Random: each send selects a random template.

   - Sequential: rotate templates in the pasted/import order (useful when you need a reproducible de-duplication strategy).

   - Insert emojis: enable automatic insertion of emojis to increase naturalness.

   - Insert device number (optional): append the device numeric label to comments for tracing (use with caution; intended for debugging/audit).

   - Real-time comment generation (optional, ChatGPT API):

      - When enabled, the script can call ChatGPT or a similar API to generate contextual and unique comments based on the post title/description or available context—suitable when you need many unique comments.

      - Note: enabling real-time generation requires a valid API key and you must consider rate limits, costs and privacy (avoid sending sensitive data to third-party services).

   - Two common ways to guarantee unique comments:

      1. Use sequential rotation of pre-generated templates (each template is used once until exhausted).

      2. Use ChatGPT real-time generation to create unique comments per target.

7. Configure other script parameters (concurrency, task interval, account pool, etc.) and start the script when ready.

:::tip About task interval
Set a minimum and maximum interval and enable random delays. Staggered timings reduce the chance of synchronized activity spikes and lower detection risk.

## Recommendations and notes

- Test comment strategies on a small batch first to validate quality and platform response.
- Keep comment text compliant and varied; avoid sending many identical messages in a short period.
- If using real-time generation, strictly monitor API usage and costs and avoid sending sensitive information.
- Tasks may fail; check logs and retry failed rows. Processed targets will be skipped on subsequent runs.
