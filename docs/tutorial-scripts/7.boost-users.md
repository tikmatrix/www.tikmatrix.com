# Boost Users

:::warning Sunset Notice
This functionality has been integrated into [Super Marketing](./14.super-marketing.md). Please use the Super Marketing script for more powerful and flexible user-boosting features.
:::

The Boost Users feature increases exposure and engagement by bulk following or unfollowing target accounts. The system attempts to simulate real user behavior to reduce detection risk, but you should still follow platform rules and moderate usage.

## Using the Boost Users feature in Super Marketing

1. Open the script: choose “Super Marketing”.
2. Select the data source type “User account list”.
3. Paste usernames in bulk or import from a text file (one username per line); after importing choose “Append” or “Overwrite”.
4. Choose a data usage strategy:

    - Shared pool: all bot accounts interact with the same targets.

    - Single-consumption: each bot account handles different targets so each target is processed by only one account.

5. Set the repeat count per target in “User Actions — Repeats” (typically set to 1).
6. Choose the action type: Follow or Unfollow. You can further configure options in **User Actions**:

        - Profile navigation method: choose **Search User** or **Direct Open Profile**.

        - Send Direct Message (optional): if enabled, paste pre-generated multi-line DM templates (one template per line or paragraph). Configure template usage order:

                - **Random**: randomly pick one template each time.
                - **Sequential**: use templates in the pasted/imported order (can continue across task runs).

            You may also choose to automatically insert emoji into templates to increase naturalness.

7. Configure other script parameters (concurrency, delays, account pool), verify settings, then start the script.

## Recommendations and notes

- Test on a small number of targets first to ensure settings don’t trigger platform defenses.
- Set reasonable delays and concurrency to mimic human behavior and reduce risk.
- For long runs, monitor account health and task logs and adjust strategies as needed.
- Boost Users operations are not guaranteed to succeed 100%; retry failed tasks or investigate target account status if needed.
