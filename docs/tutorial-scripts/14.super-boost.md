# Super Boost

:::info
Super Boost bundles follow/unfollow, DMs, post interactions, and comment automation into one queue. Launch it when you need every selected account to warm leads or revive engagement in a single pass.
:::

## Before You Start

- Create a UTF-8 `.txt` file with either TikTok usernames or post links (one per line) that matches the actions you want to run.
- Prepare direct-message templates; each line becomes a candidate reply. Toggle `Insert emoji` later if you want TikMatrix to append emojis automatically.
- Collect comment variations or verify your OpenAI-compatible endpoint (URL, API key, model, system prompt) for AI-generated comments.
- Confirm the devices and accounts you plan to use are online in TikMatrix and meet TikTok's limits for following, messaging, and commenting.
- Decide whether profiles should be opened through in-app search or directly via URL; both routes are available in the dialog.

## Launch Steps

1. In TikMatrix, select the device or devices that should execute the script.
2. Open `Scripts` → `Super Marketing` (labeled Super Boost in this guide).
3. Choose your **Data source** (`Usernames` or `Post links`) and click `Select` to load the matching `.txt` file.
4. Enable the user actions, post actions, and comment features you need, configuring each block with the reference below.
5. Set the **Task interval** slider for the random delay between targets, then press `Start Script` (or use the multi-account start buttons if they are available in your layout).

## Settings Overview

### Data source & navigation

- **Usernames / Post links** – Determines which features stay active. Profile actions (follow, unfollow, DM) require usernames; post-only workflows can run from links alone.
- **Profile access method** – With usernames, choose `Search` to locate accounts in TikTok search or `Direct` to open profile URLs. `Direct` is helpful when search results are inconsistent.
- **File selection** – The `Select` button accepts `.txt` files and ignores blank lines automatically.

### User actions

- **Follow users** – Sends a follow tap on each profile before other actions.
- **Unfollow users** – Removes the follow. Run it on its own or after messaging; avoid enabling follow and unfollow simultaneously.
- **Send DM** – Rotates through the lines in your message block. `Insert emoji` appends a natural-looking emoji mix. The script checks TikTok's messaging restrictions and skips users who block DMs.

### Post actions

- **Max posts to process** – Sets how many posts to work through per profile or per direct-link cycle (1–50).
- **Repeat times** – Replays the post interaction loop multiple times so you can revisit the list without relaunching the script.
- **View duration** – Choose a minimum and maximum watch time (0–300 seconds). Super Boost waits for a random value inside the range before triggering interactions.
- **Post interactions** – Toggle Like, Favorite, Repost, and Share individually. When several are active, the script schedules them at different timestamps inside the view window to avoid robotic behavior.

### Comments

- **Mass Comment** – Turns on commenting for both username and link modes.
- **Manual comments** – Paste one comment per line, then pick `Random` or `Sequential`. Sequential mode walks through the list based on job order so duplicates stay low across devices.
- **AI comments** – Enable `Generate by ChatGPT`, fill in the endpoint URL, API key, model, and system prompt, then press `Test` to confirm connectivity. TikMatrix passes the post caption to your model and inserts the generated reply.
- **Insert emoji** – Adds random emojis to the final comment whether it comes from templates or AI.

### Task interval

- Set the minimum and maximum delay (in minutes) between targets. Each account waits for a random value inside the range on top of short pauses the script already adds. Use the `Reset settings` button in the dialog if you need to return to defaults.

## Execution Flow

- TikMatrix launches TikTok and switches to the chosen account when a username is specified.
- For username lists, it opens each profile using the selected access method, pauses to let the page load, and runs follow, DM, and unfollow actions in that sequence. Messaging is skipped for accounts that block DMs.
- Post interactions scroll through up to the maximum posts per cycle, watch each video for the configured duration, and skip ads, live streams, or posts already liked.
- With post link lists, Super Boost opens each URL directly, executes the configured actions, and repeats according to `Repeat times`.
- Comments draw from your templates or AI responses. Sequential mode coordinates the queue across devices so each job gets a unique entry.
- Between targets, the script adds short random pauses plus the Task interval delay to mimic human behavior.

## Best Practices

- Start with a short list to validate templates and timing before scaling.
- Combine multiple actions (for example follow + DM + like) to strengthen engagement signals.
- Keep DMs and comments conversational; avoid spammy phrases that could trigger moderation.
- Refresh your comment library regularly or adjust the AI system prompt for each campaign.
- Monitor TikTok limits and rotate accounts or proxies if you plan high-volume outreach.
