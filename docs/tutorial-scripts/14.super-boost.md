# Super Boost

The Super Boost script is a comprehensive automation tool that combines multiple TikTok engagement strategies in one powerful script. It can perform user-level actions (follow/unfollow, direct messaging) and post-level interactions (like, favorite, share, comment) on target users' profiles.

## Features

- **User Profile Access**: Navigate to target users via search or direct URL
- **Follow Operations**: Follow or unfollow target users
- **Direct Messaging**: Send personalized messages to users
- **Post Interactions**: Like, favorite, share, and follow from posts
- **Mass Commenting**: Comment on posts with pre-written content or AI-generated comments
- **ChatGPT Integration**: Generate contextual comments using AI

## Steps

1. Select the device to run the script.
2. Click `Script` > `Super Boost`.
3. Configure the data source:
   - **Target Usernames File**: Select a text file containing target usernames (one per line)
   - **User Profile Access Method**: Choose between search or direct profile access
4. Configure user-related actions:
   - **Follow Users**: Enable to follow or unfollow target users
   - **Send DM**: Enable to send direct messages
     - Enter message content
     - Option to insert random emojis
5. Configure post-related actions:
   - **Max Posts to Process**: Set how many posts to interact with per user (1-50)
   - **Post Interactions**: Enable like, favorite, share, and/or follow actions
     - Set view duration for each post
   - **Mass Comment**: Enable commenting on posts
     - Choose between pre-written comments or ChatGPT-generated comments
     - For pre-written: Enter comments (one per line) and select random/sequential order
     - For ChatGPT: Configure API settings (URL, API Key, Model, System Prompt)
6. Click `Start Script` to begin execution.

## ChatGPT Configuration

When using AI-generated comments, configure the following:

- **URL**: OpenAI API endpoint (default: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`)
- **API Key**: Your OpenAI API key (sk-...)
- **Model**: AI model to use (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4)
- **System Prompt**: Instructions for comment generation (customize for your needs)

You can test the ChatGPT configuration before running the script to ensure it works correctly.

## Workflow

1. **User Processing**: The script processes each username from the file sequentially
2. **Profile Navigation**: Accesses user profiles via search or direct URL
3. **User Actions**: Performs follow/unfollow and DM actions if enabled
4. **Post Processing**: Navigates to user's posts and performs interactions
5. **Post Interactions**: Views, likes, favorites, shares, and comments on posts as configured
6. **Next User**: Moves to the next user with randomized intervals

## Tips for Success

- **Username File**: Ensure usernames are valid and active
- **Realistic Settings**: Use reasonable intervals and limits to avoid detection
- **ChatGPT Comments**: Write clear system prompts for relevant, engaging comments
- **Mixed Actions**: Enable multiple interaction types for more natural behavior
- **Post Limits**: Process 1-3 posts per user for optimal results

## Notes

- The script includes built-in delays and randomization for natural behavior
- Some actions may fail due to privacy settings or content restrictions
- ChatGPT-generated comments require a valid OpenAI API key
- The script automatically skips ads, live streams, and already-liked content
- All settings are automatically saved for future use
