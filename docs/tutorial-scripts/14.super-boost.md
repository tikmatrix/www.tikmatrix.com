# Super Boost

Super Boost is our “all-in-one” script for growing TikTok accounts. With just one run you can follow or unfollow users, send a quick DM, and interact with their posts (like, favorite, repost, share, comment).

## What You Need

- A text file with the usernames you want to target (one per line), or a file with post links.  
- A message template if you plan to send DMs.  
- Optional: a few ready-made comments or an OpenAI/compatible key if you want AI comments.

## How to Set It Up

1. Open the app, go to `Scripts` → `Super Boost`.  
2. Pick your **data source**:
   - *Usernames* if you want to work with profiles (follow, DM, post interactions).  
   - *Post links* if you only need to boost specific posts.
3. Click **Select** to choose the matching file.  
4. Turn on the features you need:
   - **Follow / Unfollow** to manage followers.  
   - **Send DM** and write your message.  
   - **Post Interactions** to like, favorite, repost, or share. Pick how many posts to process and how long to watch each one.  
   - **Mass Comment** if you want to leave comments. Paste your lines or switch on ChatGPT and fill in the simple form (API URL, key, model, prompt).  
5. Press **Start Script**. The app will check that everything is filled in and then launch the automation.

## What the Script Does

- Opens each profile or post from your list.  
- Follows or unfollows when those options are on.  
- Sends your DM (or skips if messaging is blocked).  
- Watches the post for a short while, then performs the selected actions at natural-looking moments.  
- Skips ads, live streams, and posts you already liked.  
- Leaves comments using your templates or a quick ChatGPT answer.  
- Moves on to the next item with small random pauses so the flow feels human.

## Friendly Tips

- Start with a small batch to make sure everything looks right, then scale up.  
- Mix different actions (like + comment) for better engagement.  
- Keep your message and comment templates short and friendly.  
- If you use ChatGPT, try the **Test** button once to confirm the key works.  
- You can reset the settings to the default layout at any time.
