# Super Boost

:::info
Super Boost centralizes follow/unfollow, DMs, post interactions and comments into a single job queue. It's ideal when you want to reach prospects or re-engage followers in one run.
:::

## Steps to run

1. Select the device(s) in TikMatrix/IgMatrix that will run the script.
2. Open `Scripts` → `Super Boost`.
3. Choose **Data source** (Usernames or Post links). Click `Select` to load a `.txt` file or paste multiple lines. After import you can choose `Append` or `Overwrite`.
4. Enable the User Actions, Post Actions and Comment modules as required and configure each section below.
5. Set the **Task interval** slider to define the random delay between targets, then click `Start Script`.

## Configuration

### Data source

- **Usernames / Post links**: determines which features are available. Follow/unfollow and DM require usernames; post-only flows can run from links.
- **Import**: click `Select` or `Import txt` to load a UTF-8 `.txt` file or paste multi-line data. Choose `Append` or `Overwrite` after import.

### Data usage strategy

- **Shared pool**: all bot accounts draw from the same target pool. Useful when you want many accounts to interact with the same popular targets (e.g., push on a trending post).

- **Single-consumption**: each bot consumes distinct targets so each target is handled by only one account. Use this to avoid duplicate contacts (suitable for mass DM or single comments per target).

Choose the strategy based on campaign goals and risk management — it affects queue distribution and concurrency.

### User actions

- **Follow users**: runs a follow action when visiting the profile.
- **Unfollow users**: removes follow; can run standalone or after DMs. Avoid enabling Follow and Unfollow at the same time.
- **Send DM**: the script randomly picks a line from the message templates block; enable `Insert emoji` to append natural emojis. The script will skip users who don't allow messages.

- DM templates (pre-generated): paste multi-line templates in the Message Settings (each line/paragraph is a candidate).

- Template order: Random or Sequential.

  - Random: picks a template randomly each time.

  - Sequential: rotates templates in order, suitable for predictable de-duplication.

- Insert emoji: optionally append emojis to messages or comments to increase naturalness.

- Insert device id (optional): append a device identifier to messages/comments for tracking (use only for debugging/auditing; avoid in production).

- Real-time generation (optional, ChatGPT-compatible API):

  - When enabled, the script calls your configured generation endpoint (fill API Key / URL / model / System Prompt) to produce personalized text based on the target context.

  - Note: provide a valid API key, monitor rate limits/costs, and avoid sending sensitive data.

- Uniqueness strategies:

  1. Rotate pre-generated templates in Sequential mode (each template consumed once until exhausted).

  2. Use real-time generation (ChatGPT) to create unique text for every target.

- Always test a small batch of DMs before scaling; pay attention to privacy and compliance.

### Post actions

- **Max posts to process**: number of posts each account will process (1–50). Required when data source is Usernames.
- **Repeat times**: how many times to loop the post interaction cycle without restarting the script.
- **View duration**: set min/max watch time (0–300 seconds). The script picks a random value in the range then performs interactions.
- **Post interactions**: choose Like, Favorite, Repost and Share. If multiple actions are enabled, they will be scheduled at different moments during the view window.

### Comments

- **Mass comments**: available in both username and link modes.
- **Manual comments**: one comment per line; choose `Random` or `Sequential`. Sequential mode assigns comments across the job queue to reduce duplicates across devices.
- **AI comments**: enable `Generate by ChatGPT`, fill endpoint URL, API Key, model and System Prompt, then click `Test` to verify connectivity. TikMatrix will send the post caption to the model and post the generated comment.
- **Insert emoji**: appends random emojis to comments whether from templates or AI.

If using Sequential mode the system will combine job indices with the template order to rotate across devices; when using AI generation, apply simple quality checks (length limits, no URLs or banned words).

### Task interval

- Set min and max (minutes). The script waits a random value in range plus short internal pauses. Use `Reset settings` to restore defaults if needed.

## Execution flow

- When usernames are specified, TikMatrix starts TikTok and switches to the selected account.
- In username mode, it opens each profile (Search or Direct), waits for the page to load, and runs Follow, DM, Unfollow in sequence; DMs are skipped for users who block messages.
- Post interactions scroll through profiles or open links, watch for the configured duration, and perform the selected actions while skipping ads, live streams and already-liked content.
- With post links, the script opens each URL and executes configured actions, repeating according to Repeat times.
- Comments are taken from templates or AI output. Sequential mode coordinates assignments across devices for lower duplication.
- Between targets the script inserts short random pauses plus the Task interval to emulate human behavior.

## Best practices

- Test with small batches before scaling to validate texts and pacing.
- Combine actions (follow + DM + like) to improve engagement signals.
- Keep DMs and comments conversational and honest to reduce moderation risk.
- Refresh comment libraries or adapt the AI System Prompt per campaign.
- Monitor platform rate limits and rotate accounts or proxies for high-volume runs.
