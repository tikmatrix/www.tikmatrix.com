# Super Marketing

:::info
The Super Marketing script combines follow/unfollow, DM, post interactions, and comments into a single task queue, ideal for quickly reaching potential customers or re-engaging followers in one operation.
:::

## Steps to Run

1. In TikMatrix/IgMatrix, select the device(s) you want to run the script on (multiple selection supported).
2. Open `Scripts` → `Super Marketing`.
3. Choose **Data source** (Usernames or Post links), then click `Import txt file` to load a `.txt` file or paste multiple lines directly; after import, choose `Append` or `Overwrite`.
4. Enable User Actions, Post Actions, and Comment modules as needed, and configure them according to the instructions below.
5. Set the **Task interval** slider to define the random delay between targets, then click `Start Script` to execute the task.

## Configuration

### Data Source

- **Usernames / Post links**: determines which features are available. Follow, unfollow, and DM can only be used with usernames; if you only want to interact with posts, choose link mode.
- **Import method**: Click `Import txt file` to load a `.txt` file or paste multiple lines directly; after import, choose `Append` or `Overwrite`.

### Data Usage Strategy

- **Shared pool**: All bot accounts draw tasks from the same target pool, suitable for scenarios where multiple accounts need to interact with the same targets multiple times (e.g., concentrated push on hot posts).

- **Single-consumption**: Each bot account only processes different targets, ensuring each target is handled by only one account once, suitable for scenarios that need to avoid duplicate reach (e.g., mass DM or single unique comments).

  - **Consumption limit per task**: When using single-consumption mode, you can set a maximum number of targets each task run will consume. This prevents the first batch of tasks from consuming all available data, ensuring subsequent account rotations have targets to process. Set to 0 for unlimited consumption (default behavior).

Choose a strategy based on your goals and risk management considerations; it affects queue distribution and concurrency behavior.

### User Actions

- **Follow users**: Executes follow action first when entering the profile page.
- **Unfollow users**: Unfollows the user; can run standalone or clean up followers after DM; not recommended to enable with "Follow" simultaneously.
- **Report account**: Reports the user account for fraudulent behavior. This feature uses a fixed reporting path and does not support custom paths.

  :::warning Report Path (Fixed)
  Report → Report account → Something else → Frauds and scams
  :::

  - Note: This feature uses a predefined report path. Custom report reasons or paths are not supported.
  - Use responsibly and only for legitimate purposes. Misuse may result in account restrictions.

- **Send DM**: Randomly selects a message from the multi-line templates; enable "Insert emoji" to automatically append natural emojis. The script will detect if the recipient allows DMs and skip if unavailable.

  - DM templates (pre-generated): In "Message Settings", paste multi-line or multi-paragraph DM templates (each line/paragraph is a candidate message).

  - Template usage order: Choose "Random" or "Sequential".

    - Random: Randomly selects a template each time.

    - Sequential: Rotates templates in the order they were pasted/imported, suitable for reproducible deduplication strategies.

  - Insert emoji: Enable to automatically insert emojis in messages or comments to increase naturalness.

  - Real-time generation (optional, ChatGPT or compatible API):

    - When enabled, the script can call your configured generation endpoint (fill in API Key / URL / model / System Prompt) to generate personalized text based on target context.

    - Note: Provide a valid API Key and be aware of rate limits, costs, and privacy compliance (avoid sending sensitive data).

  - Uniqueness strategies: Common ways to ensure each message/comment is unique:

      1. Use "Sequential" mode to rotate pre-generated templates (templates used only once until exhausted).
      2. Use real-time generation (ChatGPT) to generate unique text for each target.

  - Before using mass DM, be sure to test with small batches and pay attention to privacy and compliance requirements.

### Post Actions

- **Max posts to process**: Determines the number of posts each account will process (1–50), only required when data source is "Usernames".
- **Repeat times**: Repeats the post interaction loop multiple times without restarting the script.
- **View duration**: Set minimum and maximum watch time (0–300 seconds). The script will randomly select a value within the range before performing interactions.
- **Post interactions**: Can individually enable Like, Favorite, Repost, and Share. When multiple actions are enabled, the system will distribute them at different time points during the viewing period for more natural behavior.

- **Comments**: When enabled, you can post comments on posts.

     If "Comments" is enabled, configure the following in Comment Settings:

  - Pre-generated comment templates: Paste multi-line or multi-paragraph pre-generated comment templates (each line or paragraph is a candidate comment).

  - Template usage order: Choose "Random" or "Sequential".
    - Random: Randomly selects from candidate templates each time.
    - Sequential: Uses templates in the order they were pasted/imported (suitable for reproducible deduplication strategies).

  - Insert emoji: Enable to automatically insert emojis in comments to increase naturalness.

  - Real-time comment generation (optional, ChatGPT API):
    - When enabled, the script can call ChatGPT-like APIs to generate context-relevant and unique comment text based on post title/description in real-time. This method can significantly reduce the risk of duplicate comments, suitable for scenarios requiring a large number of unique comments.
    - Note: Using real-time generation requires a valid API Key, and be aware of rate limits, costs, and privacy compliance (do not send sensitive data to third-party services).

  - Two common ways to ensure unique comments:
         1. Use "Sequential" to load and rotate pre-generated comment templates (ensuring each template is used only once until exhausted).
         2. Use ChatGPT API to generate each comment in real-time (dynamically generated based on post title/content, naturally easier to ensure uniqueness).

  - Suggestion: Test comment strategy with small batches first, check comment quality and platform handling; if using real-time generation, monitor API call volume and costs.

  - If using "Sequential" strategy, the system will combine task numbers to rotate templates across multiple devices, reducing duplication probability; if using AI generation, it's recommended to apply simple quality check rules (such as length range, prohibit URLs / sensitive words).

### Merge tasks (Merge tasks for the same username)

- Description: When "Merge tasks for the same username" is enabled, multiple targets for the same username are executed inside a single task unit (sequentially or in parallel depending on implementation). Even if one target fails, the overall task will not be aborted and the remaining targets will continue to run, reducing task switching and scheduling overhead.

- Behavior when enabled: Multiple targets aimed at the same account are grouped into a single task unit. Failures affect only the individual target and are recorded, but they won't block other targets from continuing. This mode is suitable for large-scale marketing runs and can significantly reduce task start/switch overhead.

- Behavior when disabled: Each target is created as an individual task; any failure is reported immediately and stops that sub-task (without affecting other independent tasks). This mode is suitable when you need precise per-target monitoring and alerts.

- Recommendations:
  - Enable this mode for high-throughput, large-batch marketing to lower scheduling costs.
  - Disable it when you require exact per-target execution status and want immediate action on failures (e.g., human intervention or immediate rollback).

### Task Interval

- Set minimum and maximum values (in minutes). The script will randomly wait within the range between each target, plus its own short pauses.

## Execution Flow

- If multi-account mode is enabled, TikMatrix/IgMatrix will first launch TikTok/Instagram and switch to the corresponding account.
- In username mode, the system opens each profile page using the selected access method, waits for loading to complete, then sequentially executes follow, DM, unfollow actions; if the recipient blocks DMs, it will automatically skip.
- Post interactions will scroll through profile pages or open links directly, watch according to the set quantity and duration, and perform like, favorite, repost, share actions, skipping ads, live streams, and already-liked content.
- When using post links, the script will open links one by one, execute configured actions, and loop according to "Repeat times".
- The comment module will draw from templates or AI output. Sequential mode will combine task numbers to distribute different comments across multiple devices.
- Between each target, the script will add small random pauses, then add the random wait from task interval to simulate human rhythm.

## Best Practices

- Validate text and pacing with small batches first, then scale up after confirming no issues.
- Combining multiple actions (such as follow + DM + like) can improve account engagement signals.
- Keep DMs and comments conversational and sincere to avoid triggering platform moderation.
- Regularly update comment libraries or adjust AI System Prompt to make content more relevant to campaign themes.
- Monitor platform rate limits; for large volumes, rotate accounts or proxy nodes.
