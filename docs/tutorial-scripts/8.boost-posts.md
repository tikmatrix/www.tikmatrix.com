# Boost Posts

:::warning Sunset Notice
This functionality has been integrated into [Super Marketing](./14.super-marketing.md). Please use the Super Marketing script for more powerful and flexible post-boosting features.
:::

The Boost Posts feature increases engagement by bulk liking, sharing, favoriting, reposting, and watching posts. The system attempts to simulate real user behavior to reduce detection risk, but you should still follow platform rules and moderate usage.

## Using the Boost Posts feature in Super Marketing

1. Open the script: choose “Super Marketing”.
2. Select the data source type “Post URL list”.
3. Paste post URLs in bulk or import from a text file; after importing choose “Append” or “Overwrite” the existing list.
4. Choose a data usage strategy:

    - Shared pool: all bot accounts interact with the same posts.

    - Single-consumption: each bot account interacts with different posts so each post is handled by only one account.

5. Set the repeat count per post in “Post Actions — Repeats”. If comments are enabled, set comment repeats to 1 to avoid duplicate comments.
6. In “Post Actions” select the interaction types you want: Like, Share, Repost, Favorite, Comment, Watch video, etc.

     If you select “Comment”, configure the comment options as follows:

     - Pre-generated comment templates: paste multi-line or multi-paragraph comment templates (each line/paragraph is treated as a candidate comment).

     - Template usage order: choose **Random** or **Sequential**.
         - Random: randomly pick one template each time.
         - Sequential: use templates in the pasted/imported order (useful for deterministic de-duplication).

     - Emoji insertion: optionally enable automatic insertion of emoji into comments to increase naturalness.

     - Realtime comment generation (optional — ChatGPT API):
         - When enabled, the script may call a ChatGPT-like API to generate context-aware, unique comments based on the post title/description. This significantly reduces repeated comments and is suitable when many unique comments are required.
         - Notes: using realtime generation requires a valid API key and attention to rate limits, costs, and privacy (avoid sending sensitive data to third-party services).

     - Two common ways to ensure unique comments:
         1. Load and rotate pre-generated templates in **Sequential** mode (each template is used once until exhausted).
         2. Use the ChatGPT API to generate a unique comment per post (dynamic generation based on post content).

     - Recommendation: test your comment strategy on a small batch, review comment quality and platform handling; if using realtime generation, monitor API usage and cost.

7. Configure other script parameters (concurrency, delays, account pool), verify settings, then start the script.

## Recommendations and notes

- Test on a small number of posts first to ensure settings don’t trigger platform defenses.
- Keep comment text varied and natural; avoid copying the same text.
- Set reasonable delays and concurrency to mimic human behavior and reduce risk.
- For long runs, monitor account health and task logs and adjust strategies as needed.
