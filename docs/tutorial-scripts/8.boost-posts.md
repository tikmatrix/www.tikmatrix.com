# Boost Posts

The Boost Posts script is used to increase engagement on posts by liking, sharing, favoriting, and viewing them in bulk.

## Steps

1. Select the device to run the script.
2. Click `Script` > `Boost Posts`.
3. Configure the task settings:
    - **Post URLs**: Enter target post URLs, one per line.
    - **Boost Options**: Choose to like, share, repost, favorite, or follow the user.
    - **View Duration**: Set how long to view each post.
    - **Boost Post Interval**: Set the interval between each task.
4. Click `Start Script` to begin.

## Note

- The boost posts script may not always succeed; retry failed tasks if needed.
- The **Share** option will open the SMS app to increase share count without actually sending messages.
