# Boost Posts

The Boost Posts script is used to increase engagement on posts by liking, sharing, favoriting, and viewing them in bulk. Our advanced algorithm mimics natural human behavior to avoid detection.

## How It Works

### Smart Interaction Timing

Unlike traditional automation tools that perform all actions at the end of viewing, TikMatrix uses an intelligent randomization system:

1. **Random Scheduling**: Each interaction (like, favorite, follow, repost, share) is assigned a random execution time within the viewing duration
2. **Natural Distribution**: Actions are spread throughout the viewing period, simulating how real users interact with content
3. **Organic Behavior**: No two sessions follow the same pattern, making the automation virtually undetectable

### Workflow Process

1. **Post Opening**: The script navigates to the target post URL
2. **Viewing Simulation**: Begins watching the video for the specified duration
3. **Randomized Interactions**: Executes enabled actions at random intervals during viewing:
   - **Likes**: Triggered at random moments (1s to view_duration)
   - **Favorites**: Added at unpredictable times during viewing
   - **Follows**: User following happens at natural intervals
   - **Reposts**: Content sharing occurs organically
   - **SMS Shares**: Share count increases without actual message sending
4. **Completion**: All actions complete within the viewing timeframe

## Steps

1. Select the device to run the script.
2. Click `Script` > `Boost Posts`.
3. Configure the task settings:
    - **Post URLs**: Enter target post URLs, one per line.
    - **Boost Options**: Choose to like, share, repost, favorite, or follow the user.
    - **View Duration**: Set how long to view each post (actions will be randomized within this time).
    - **Boost Post Interval**: Set the interval between each task.
4. Click `Start Script` to begin.

## Anti-Detection Features

### Behavioral Randomization

- **Variable Timing**: No fixed patterns in interaction timing
- **Human-like Delays**: Natural pauses between actions
- **Adaptive Scheduling**: Each session creates unique interaction patterns

### Technical Safeguards

- **WebView Detection**: Automatically handles browser redirects
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failed interactions
- **Session Management**: Proper cleanup between posts

## Note

- The boost posts script may not always succeed; retry failed tasks if needed.
- The **Share** option will open the SMS app to increase share count without actually sending messages.
- All interactions are randomized to prevent detection - no two runs will have identical timing patterns.
