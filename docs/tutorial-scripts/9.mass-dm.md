# Mass DM

:::warning
Mass DM lets you coordinate large account farms to deliver a unique message to every target profile. TikMatrix automatically divides the workload across the accounts selected on your devices so that each target receives at least one message.
:::

Use the Mass DM script to send personalised TikTok direct messages in bulk—ideal for outreach, support campaigns, or onboarding flows.

## Steps

1. Select the device (or devices) that contain the TikTok accounts you want to use.
2. In the app, go to `Script` > `Mass DM`.
3. Configure the task settings as described below.
4. Press `Start Script` to launch the campaign.

## Task settings explained

- **Message contents** – Type the text you want to send. Enter multiple lines to rotate through several templates automatically.
- **Insert emojis** – Toggle on to append a friendly emoji sequence to each outgoing message for extra variation.
- **Target usernames file** – Pick a `.txt` file that lists your targets, one handle per line (with or without the leading `@`).
- **Open user method** – Choose `Search` to locate each profile via TikTok search, or `Direct` to jump straight to the profile URL.
- **Task interval** – Drag the slider to set the minimum and maximum delay (in minutes) between tasks for each account.

:::info Distribution example
If you load 1,000 target usernames and select 100 TikMatrix accounts across your devices, each account will message roughly 10 targets. The system balances the queue automatically.
:::

:::tip About task intervals
Every account waits for a random delay between the minimum and maximum values you set. Slightly staggered start times reduce the risk of all devices acting in sync, which helps avoid rate limits.
:::

## Notes

- Keep your target list in plain text format to avoid hidden characters.
- TikMatrix only automates message delivery. We cannot guarantee that accounts stay safe from bans or that every DM reaches its recipient.
- If a campaign stops or some targets fail, simply review the report and retry the unsuccessful rows.
