# Mass DM

:::warning
This feature has been merged into the [Super Marketing script](./14.super-marketing.md). Please prefer Super Marketing for more powerful and flexible mass messaging and message management.
:::

Mass DM is used to build connections by sending direct messages (DMs) in bulk—useful for promotion, customer follow-up, and re-engagement. The system supports both pre-generated templates and real-time generation, and it aims to mimic human-like timing to reduce detection risk.

## Using Mass DM inside Super Marketing

1. Open the Super Marketing script.
2. Select the data source type: "User account list (target list)".
3. Paste target usernames in bulk or import a `.txt` file (one username per line). After import you can choose to "Append" or "Replace" the current list.
4. Choose a data usage strategy:

   - Shared pool: all bot accounts will message from the same target pool.

   - Single-consumption: each bot account processes different targets so each target receives a message from only one account.

5. Set how many messages to send per target (usually 1 to avoid repeated contact).
6. Configure message settings:

   - Pre-generated templates: paste multiple lines or paragraphs of prepared DM copy. Each line/paragraph is treated as a candidate message.

   - Message order: choose "Random" or "Sequential".

   - Random: each send selects a random template.

   - Sequential: rotate templates in the pasted/import order (useful when you need a reproducible de-duplication strategy).

   - Insert emojis: enable automatic insertion of emojis to increase naturalness.

   - Real-time message generation (optional, ChatGPT API):

   - When enabled, the script can call ChatGPT or a similar API to generate personalised messages based on the target username or available context—suitable when you need many unique messages.

   - Note: enabling real-time generation requires a valid API key and you must consider rate limits, costs and privacy (avoid sending sensitive data to third-party APIs).

   - Two common ways to guarantee unique messages:

   1. Use sequential rotation of pre-generated templates (each template is used once until exhausted).

   2. Use ChatGPT real-time generation to create unique messages per target.

7. Configure how to open user profiles (if the task needs to view profiles): choose "Search" or "Direct Open Profile".
8. Configure task interval (min/max in minutes), concurrency and account pool settings, then start the script.

:::tip About task interval
Set a minimum and maximum interval and enable random delays. Staggered timings reduce the chance of synchronized activity spikes and lower detection risk.

## Recommendations and notes

- Keep DM content compliant and diverse; avoid sending many identical messages in a short time.
- If using real-time generation, monitor API usage and costs closely and avoid sending sensitive information.
- Tasks may fail; check logs and retry failed rows. Processed targets will be skipped on subsequent runs.
