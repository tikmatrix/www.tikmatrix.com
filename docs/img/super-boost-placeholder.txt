# Super Boost Screenshot Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the Super Boost script screenshot.

The actual screenshot (super-boost.png) should be captured from the TikZenX application showing the Super Boost dialog interface with all the configuration options:

1. User Data Source section
2. User Related Actions section (Follow Users, Send DM)
3. Post Related Actions section (Post Interactions, Mass Comment)
4. ChatGPT configuration (when enabled)

The screenshot should show the complete interface to help users understand all available options and settings.

## Screenshot Requirements:
- Format: PNG
- Filename: super-boost.png
- Location: /docs/img/
- Content: Full Super Boost dialog interface
