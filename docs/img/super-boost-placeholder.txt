# Super Marketing Screenshot Placeholder

1. User Data Source section
2. User Related Actions section (Follow Users, Send DM)
3. Post Related Actions section (Post Interactions, Mass Comment)
4. ChatGPT configuration (when enabled)

The screenshot should show the complete interface to help users understand all available options and settings.
