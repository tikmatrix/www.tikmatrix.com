# White Label Setup Screenshot Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the White Label setup screenshot.

The actual screenshot (whitelabel-setup.png) should be captured from the TikZenX application showing the White Label settings dialog interface with all the configuration options:

1. App Name input field
2. Logo upload section
3. Brand settings (Support Email, Tutorial URL, Rewards URL, Telegram URL)
4. Feature toggles (Show Tutorial Link, Show Brand Info)
5. Save button

The screenshot should show the complete interface to help users understand all available options and settings.

## Screenshot Requirements:
- Format: PNG
- Filename: whitelabel-setup.png
- Location: /docs/img/
- Content: Full White Label settings dialog interface
