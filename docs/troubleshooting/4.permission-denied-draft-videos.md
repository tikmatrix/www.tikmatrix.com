# Permission Denied - Unable to Save Draft Videos

## Resolving Permission Denied Issues on Mobile Screen

### Problem Description

When running post scripts, you may encounter the following prompt on your mobile screen:

```text
Permission denied. Unable to save draft videos.
```

### Solution

This issue occurs because the TikTok app lacks storage permissions. Follow these steps to resolve it:

#### Step 1: Manually Click the Publish Button

1. Locate and tap the **Publish** button on your mobile screen
2. Continue with the publishing process

#### Step 2: Grant System Permissions

1. When the system permission request dialog appears, tap **Allow**
2. Ensure you grant the TikTok app the required storage permissions

### Important Note

:::info
This permission setup process only needs to be performed once. Once permissions are granted, subsequent post script runs will not encounter this issue.
:::

### Prevention Measures

To avoid this issue, it's recommended to do the following before first using TikMatrix:

1. Manually open the TikTok app
2. Try recording or saving a video draft
3. Select **Allow** when prompted for permissions
4. This will preconfigure the necessary permissions
