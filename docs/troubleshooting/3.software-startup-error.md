# Software Startup Error

## Troubleshooting Common Startup Errors

### Step 1: Check System Requirements

1. Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements:
   - Windows 10 or later
   - At least 4GB RAM
   - At least 1GB free disk space

### Step 2: Check Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable

If you see errors like `vcruntime140.dll not found` or `The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b)`, you may be missing the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable.

1. Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
2. Run: `dir "C:\Windows\System32\vcruntime*.dll"`
3. If you see output, the redistributable is installed. The filename (e.g., vcruntime140.dll) indicates the version.
4. If not, download and install the latest version: [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

### Step 3: Check Antivirus Software

1. Temporarily disable your antivirus software.
2. Try launching TikMatrix again.
3. If successful, add TikMatrix to your antivirus exclusion list.

### Step 4: Check System Time

Incorrect system time can cause "Agent Start Timeout" errors:

1. Right-click on the time display in the bottom-right corner of your screen
2. Select "Adjust date/time"
3. Enable "Set time automatically" if it's not already enabled
4. If the time is still incorrect, click "Sync now" or manually set the correct date and time
5. Restart TikMatrix after correcting the time

### Step 5: Fix Agent Start Timeout Error

If you see an "Agent Start Timeout" error:

1. Click `Settings`
2. Click `Open App Directory`
3. Delete all folders
4. Restart TikMatrix

### Step 6: Check Application Logs

1. Click `Settings` > `Open App Directory` in TikMatrix.
2. Go to the `logs` folder.
3. Check the most recent log file for error messages.
