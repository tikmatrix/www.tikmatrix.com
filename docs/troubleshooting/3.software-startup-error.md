# Software Startup Error

## Common Software Startup Error Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check System Requirements

1. Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements:
   - Windows 10 or later
   - 4GB RAM minimum
   - 1GB free disk space

### Step 2: Check Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable

Usually, errors like `vcruntime140.dll not found` or `The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b)` are caused by missing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable.

1. Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd` and press Enter
2. Type `dir "C:\Windows\System32\vcruntime*.dll"` and press Enter
3. If there is output, it means the relevant version of Visual C++ Redistributable is installed. The filename suffix of vcruntime usually includes a version number, such as vcruntime140.dll (corresponding to 2015-2022).
4. If there is no output, please download and install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable: [Latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Version](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

### Step 3: Check Antivirus Software

1. Temporarily disable your antivirus software
2. Try launching TikMatrix again
3. If successful, add TikMatrix to your antivirus software's exclusion list

### Step 4: Check Application Logs

1. Click the `Open App Directory` button
2. Navigate to the `logs` folder
3. Check the most recent log file for error messages

### Step 5: Reinstall the Application

1. Click the `Open App Directory` button and delete all folders
2. Reinstall TikMatrix
