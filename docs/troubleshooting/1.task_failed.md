# Task Failed

## Automatic Task Retry System

TikMatrix now includes an intelligent automatic retry system for failed tasks. When a task fails during execution:

- The task is automatically rescheduled with a **5-60 second delay** before the next retry attempt
- Each retry attempt is tracked and displayed in the task management interface
- This helps ensure temporary issues (like network glitches or app lag) don't permanently fail your tasks
- No manual intervention is required - the system handles retries transparently
- You can configure a maximum retry count for tasks; once exceeded the task will be marked as failed

You can monitor retry attempts in the task list, where you'll see a retry count column showing how many times each task has been attempted.

## Troubleshooting Task Execution Failures

### Step 1: Check Agent Status

1. Open the Agent application.
2. Ensure the TikMatrix app is running on your phone.
3. Check if the status shows success within 10 seconds.
4. If Agent status is failed, follow the steps in [Initialize Device](../tutorial-basics/2.init-device.md) to troubleshoot.

### Step 2: Check TikTok App Status

1. Verify TikTok is installed correctly.
2. Click "Open TikTok" to see if the app launches on your phone.
3. Click "Close TikTok" to see if the app closes properly.
4. Ensure these operations work as expected.
5. If not, refer to [Install TikTok](../tutorial-basics/3.install-tiktok.md) for troubleshooting.

### Step 3: Check TikTok Language Settings

TikMatrix only supports TikTok in English. If your app is not in English:

1. Open TikTok on your phone.
2. Go to your profile.
3. Tap the three dots in the upper right to open settings.
4. Scroll to "Language" and select "English".

### Step 4: Submit a Support Ticket

If the above checks do not reveal the issue, please create a support ticket — we will automatically collect logs and assist you. Follow these steps:

1. Click the "Help" button in the upper-right corner of the application.
2. Click "Create Ticket".
3. Enter your contact information and a brief description of the issue.
4. Select the affected device(s) (you can choose multiple devices).
5. Click "Submit" to create the ticket.

## Known Issues

### First-Time Phone Connection

Sometimes task failures occur when connecting a new phone for the first time. This is a common issue that can be resolved by:

1. Completely closing the TikMatrix software
2. Restarting the TikMatrix application
3. Running your task again

This issue typically happens during the initial device setup process and usually resolves after restarting the software.

### Port Conflict Error

If you encounter the following error message in the logs:

```text
error: CustomError("192.168.31.11:5555 :waitForExists timeout -> text('Profile') -> Failed to jsonrpc: http://127.0.0.1:50428/jsonrpc/0 method: waitForExists error: error sending request for url (http://127.0.0.1:50428/jsonrpc/0): error trying to connect: tcp connect error: The connection could not be established because the target computer refused the connection request. (os error 10061)")
```

This indicates a port conflict issue. To resolve this:

1. **Restart TikMatrix software** completely and try again
2. **Avoid using other control software** while TikMatrix is running, as they may cause port conflicts
3. Ensure no other applications are using the same communication ports

This error typically occurs when multiple device control applications are running simultaneously, causing communication port conflicts.
