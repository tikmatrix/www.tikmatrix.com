# Troubleshooting Steps for Task Failure

## Step 1: Check Agent Status (if the task failed to start)

1. Click the sidebar: General → Open Agent.
2. Make sure the phone has the TikMatrix app open.
3. Observe whether a success status appears within 10 seconds.
4. If the Agent shows a failure status, follow the manual initialization steps in the Initialize Device guide: ../tutorial-basics/2.init-device.md

## Step 2: Check TikTok/Instagram App Configuration (if the script fails to open/close the app correctly)

1. If you are using the official TikTok/Instagram app, click "Open TikTok" / "Open Instagram" and check whether the app opens correctly on the device. If it does not, click the settings button in the title bar and select the correct TikTok version (International / Asia). Instagram has only the official version.
2. If you are using a cloned version of TikTok/Instagram, ensure you have configured the cloned app package name in the **Account List**. See the guide for using cloned apps: ../tutorial-basics/10.clone-apps-support.md. Also make sure **Multi-account Mode** is enabled when running tasks.

## Step 3: Check TikTok/Instagram Language Settings

Currently we only support the English language for TikTok and Instagram. If your apps are not in English, set them to English as follows:

1. Open the TikTok app on the device.
2. Go to your profile.
3. Tap the three dots in the top-right to open Settings.
4. Scroll to the "Language" section.
5. Select "English" as the app language.
6. Repeat the steps to set Instagram to English.

## Step 4: Run a Test Script

1. Click the sidebar: Scripts → Test Script.
2. Wait for the script to finish.
3. If the test fails, check the logs and try to resolve the issue. See the "Known Issues" section below for common problems.

## Step 5: Submit a Support Ticket

If the previous four steps did not identify the problem, please create a support ticket. We will collect logs automatically and help you troubleshoot. Steps:

1. Click the "Support" button in the title bar.
2. Click "Create Ticket".
3. Enter your contact information and a description of the issue. To speed up resolution, please attach a screen recording of the script execution.
4. Select the affected devices (you may select multiple). This is important — we can only receive logs for devices you select.
5. Click "Submit".
6. We may request additional information, such as the UI XML file for the last screen before failure: manually navigate the phone to the last page before the task fails, click the device screen's right-side "Debug" button, then click "Download XML". Send the downloaded XML and the ticket number to our support email: [support@tikmatrix.com](mailto:support@tikmatrix.com)
