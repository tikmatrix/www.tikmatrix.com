# Task Failed

## Automatic Task Retry System

TikMatrix now includes an intelligent automatic retry system for failed tasks. When a task fails during execution:

- The task is automatically rescheduled with a **5-60 second delay** before the next retry attempt
- Each retry attempt is tracked and displayed in the task management interface
- This helps ensure temporary issues (like network glitches or app lag) don't permanently fail your tasks
- No manual intervention is required - the system handles retries transparently

You can monitor retry attempts in the task list, where you'll see a retry count column showing how many times each task has been attempted.

## Troubleshooting Task Execution Failures

### Step 1: Check Agent Status

1. Open the Agent application.
2. Ensure the TikMatrix app is running on your phone.
3. Check if the status shows success within 10 seconds.
4. If Agent status is failed, follow the steps in [Initialize Device](../tutorial-basics/2.init-device.md) to troubleshoot.

### Step 2: Check TikTok App Status

1. Verify TikTok is installed correctly.
2. Click "Open TikTok" to see if the app launches on your phone.
3. Click "Close TikTok" to see if the app closes properly.
4. Ensure these operations work as expected.
5. If not, refer to [Install TikTok](../tutorial-basics/3.install-tiktok.md) for troubleshooting.

### Step 3: Check TikTok Language Settings

TikMatrix only supports TikTok in English. If your app is not in English:

1. Open TikTok on your phone.
2. Go to your profile.
3. Tap the three dots in the upper right to open settings.
4. Scroll to "Language" and select "English".

### Step 4: View Task Logs

If the above steps do not resolve the issue, check the logs and contact support:

1. Click on the phone screen in TikMatrix.
2. Click the "Log" button in the lower right of the operation panel.
3. Review the detailed log information.
4. Copy the last 10 lines of the log.
5. Send the log to technical support for analysis.

## Known Issues

### First-Time Phone Connection

Sometimes task failures occur when connecting a new phone for the first time. This is a common issue that can be resolved by:

1. Completely closing the TikMatrix software
2. Restarting the TikMatrix application
3. Running your task again

This issue typically happens during the initial device setup process and usually resolves after restarting the software.
