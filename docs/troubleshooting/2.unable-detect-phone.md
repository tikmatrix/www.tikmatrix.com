# Unable to Detect Phone

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check ADB Connection

1. Click `Settings` > `Open ADB Terminal` in TikMatrix.
2. Run `adb devices` and check if your phone appears in the list with status `device`.

### For Windows systems

```shell
.\adb.exe devices
```

### For Mac/Linux systems

```shell
./adb devices
```

### Output Example

```shell
List of devices attached
<DEVICE_ID>    <STATUS>
```

### If the Device Is Not Listed

Follow the troubleshooting steps in [Connect Device](../tutorial-basics/1.connect-to-devices.md).

### If the Device Status Is `unauthorized`

This means the device is not authorized. Tap `Allow USB debugging` on your phone.

### If the Device Status Is `offline`

This usually means a loose USB connection. Reconnect your phone by unplugging and replugging the USB cable.

### If the Device Status Is `device`

The device is connected successfully. If TikMatrix still cannot detect the phone, ensure TikMatrix is activated (free trial also requires activation).
