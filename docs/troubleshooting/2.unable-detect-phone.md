# Unable to Detect Phone

## Unable to Detect Phone Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check ADB Connection Status

1. Click the `Open App Directory` button
2. Enter the `platform-tools` directory
3. Right-click in the blank area and select `Open Command Prompt Here`
4. Input `adb devices` command and press `Enter`, check if your phone appears in the adb device list and its status is `device`

### If the device is not listed in adb devices

Please follow the troubleshooting steps in the [Initialize Device](../tutorial-basics/2.init-device.md) documentation

### If the device status is `unauthorized`

The possible reason is that the device is not authorized. Please click `Allow USB debugging` on your phone

### If the device status is `offline`

The possible reason is a loose USB connection. Please reconnect your phone by unplugging and replugging the USB cable

### If the device status is `device`

The device is successfully connected. If TikMatrix still cannot detect the phone, please confirm if TikMatrix is activated. Free trial also requires activation on the authorization page

### If the problem persists

Please contact our support team [Telegram](https://t.me/tikmatrix_support) with the following information:
