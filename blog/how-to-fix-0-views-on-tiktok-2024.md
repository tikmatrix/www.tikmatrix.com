## Why Your TikTok Videos get 0 Views and How to Fix It

If you're experiencing 0 views on your TikTok page, there may be underlying issues with your content strategy. In this post, I'll delve into common problems and offer solutions to help you overcome them.

### 1. **Give Your Page Time to Verify**

TikTok often requires a waiting period before your page is fully accessible. This could take anywhere from 1 to 7 days. During this time, you might encounter difficulties interacting with other accounts. Patience is key here; wait it out and keep checking until your page is verified.

### 2. **Under-Reviewed Videos**

Your video might be under review, especially if it contains flagged content or keywords. TikTok may take some time to assess its suitability for the platform. If you suspect this is the case, try sharing the video. If it's under review, TikTok will inform you.

### 3. **Poor Content Quality**

Low-quality videos, characterized by pixelation or lighting issues, are less likely to be promoted by TikTok's algorithm. Ensure your content meets quality standards to engage viewers effectively.

### 4. **Avoid Reposting Content**

Reposting content from other platforms is discouraged by TikTok. It's essential to create original content to maintain platform integrity and increase your chances of visibility.

### 5. **Beware of Restricted Keywords**

Using restricted keywords or hashtags can flag your content, limiting its reach. Steer clear of topics like finance, religion, or controversial figures to avoid this issue.

### 6. **Shadowban Concerns**

While rare, shadowbanning can occur if you repeatedly violate TikTok's guidelines. Symptoms include a significant drop in views and limited exposure on the "For You" page. To address this, continue posting quality content, and avoid previous violations. Taking a brief hiatus from posting may also help reset your account's status.

By addressing these potential issues and implementing the suggested solutions, you can optimize your TikTok strategy and increase your chances of success. Remember to focus on creating engaging, original content that resonates with your audience.
