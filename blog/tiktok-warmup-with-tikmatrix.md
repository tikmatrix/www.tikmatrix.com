## 🧠 1. What “Warm-up” Really Means

Warm-up is a **staged behavior plan** that looks like a real person getting familiar with TikTok.  
Goals:

- Establish a consistent device/network identity
- Build early engagement signals (watch time, likes, follows)
- Avoid “automation patterns” that trigger risk control

> Principle: **Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.** Don’t chase views on Day 1.

---

## 🛠️ 2. Pre-checks (Before Day 1)

- **Device:** physical Android only; avoid previously “dirty” devices  
- **Network:** clean residential/dedicated IP; one device ↔ one proxy  
- **Profile:** set avatar/name/bio later (Day 3+), not at minute 1  
- **App locale:** match your target country (language/region)  
- **System noise:** disable location, remove non-target keyboards/apps

---

## 📅 3. 7-Day Warm-up Timeline (Baseline)

| Day | Actions | Volume | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1–2 | Browse FYP, watch to end; 2–4 random likes/session | 2–3 sessions/day, 10–20 mins each | No follows, no comments |
| 3–5 | Keep browsing; add 1–2 follows/day; 1 first post | 1 post total | Soft caption; no aggressive hashtags |
| 6–7 | Light comments (1–3/day), 2nd post | 1 post | Mix watch, like, follow, comment |

> Spread actions across **separate sessions** with irregular start times.

---

## ⏱️ 4. Human-like Rates & Delays

- Scroll dwell: **5–15 s short** / **≥100% video length** for targeted pieces  
- Like probability: **15–35%** of watched posts  
- Follow probability: **≤10%** of profiles visited  
- Comments: **0 on Day 1–2**, **1–3/day from Day 6**  
- Session length: **10–25 min**, 2–3 sessions/day

---

## 🎬 5. Content Strategy in Warm-up

- Start with **low-risk, native-feel** vertical videos (15–25s)  
- Use **original audio** or trending sounds at low volume  
- Keep captions neutral; avoid spammy CTAs  
- Post at **Day 3–5** (first) and **Day 6–7** (second)

---

## 🧪 6. What to Watch (Signals)

- **View-to-like** ratio (early posts 3–12%)  
- **Average watch time** trending up across sessions  
- **Account stability:** no frequent verifications, no rate limits

If you see friction (captcha bursts, sudden logout), **pause 24–48h**, reduce volumes.

---

## ❌ 7. Common Pitfalls

- Mass profile edits + mass follows on Day 1  
- Identical timings across devices  
- Recycled/low-quality videos only  
- Shared VPNs or flagged IP ranges

---

## 🤖 8. Using TikMatrix “Account Warm-up Script”

**Path:** Scripts → **Account Warm-up**  
**Suggested config:**

- **Randomized delays** (broad ranges per section 4)  
- **Max likes/session:** 6–10; **follows/day:** 1–2 (Day 3+)  
- **Enable swipe trajectory randomness & typing simulation**  
- **Stagger devices** (offset start by 2–7 min)  
- **Per-device proxy** binding

> Start with **5–10 devices** to validate your proxy pool before scaling.

---

## ✅ 9. Risk Control Checklist

| Category | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Device | Physical Android; powered hubs; unique fingerprints |
| Network | One device ↔ one residential/dedicated proxy |
| Timing | Sessions 2–3/day; irregular starts; long pauses between blocks |
| Behavior | Low volumes first; add follows/comments only after Day 3 |
| Content | Short, native-feel, non-spammy; avoid heavy hashtags early |
| Tooling | Use TikMatrix randomization; stagger devices; per-device logs |
