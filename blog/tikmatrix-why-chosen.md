## 🔒 1. Account Safety — Stable Operation with Minimal Risk

TikMatrix simulates **human-like behavior** (randomized taps, swipes, typing) and supports **per-device proxy isolation** to reduce synchronized patterns.

- Warm-up scripts to age accounts safely  
- Randomized timers, delays, and gesture paths  
- Per-task variance to avoid “copy-paste” footprints

> **Goal:** Keep accounts alive first; growth starts from survivability.

## 🔁 2. Multi-Account Switching — 8 Accounts per Device

Operate **up to 8 accounts per phone** with smart session handling.

- Fast switching without repeated logins  
- Optional profile setup (avatar, bio, username)

| Device Count | Accounts per Device | Total Accounts |
|---|---:|---:|
| 10 | 8 | 80 |
| 25 | 8 | 200 |
| 50 | 8 | 400 |
