## 🧭 1. What Is Device Grouping (and Why It Scales)

**Device Grouping** lets you organize real Android phones into logical buckets (Groups).  
Each phone can bind **up to 8 TikTok accounts**, and each Group can run different scripts independently.

- Group by **use case**: warm-up, posting, follow/unfollow, live support  
- Group by **risk level**: test accounts vs. main revenue accounts  
- Group by **team ownership**: who operates/monitors which devices

> **Key idea:** Organized devices → predictable automation → safer scale.

## 🧩 2. How It Works (Conceptual Model)

- **Devices**: physical Android phones connected via USB/Wi-Fi  
- **Accounts per device**: up to **8** TikTok accounts bound to each device  
- **Groups**: label devices into buckets (e.g., “WarmUp-A”, “Posting-EU”)  
- **Scripts**: run per Group with different parameters and schedules

| Layer | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Device | Pixel_12_03 | Hardware identity & proxies |
| Accounts | 6–8 per device | Capacity unit |
| Group | `WarmUp-A`, `Post-B` | Isolation by task/risk |
| Script | Warm, Post, Follow | Automate per-Group actions |

## ⚙️ 3. Quick Setup (Step-by-Step)

1. **Connect devices** and verify they appear in TikMatrix  
2. **Bind accounts** on each device (≤ 8 per device)  
3. **Create Groups** (e.g., `WarmUp-A`, `Posting-Main`, `Follow-Geo-US`)  
4. **Assign devices** to the appropriate Groups  
5. **Choose scripts** per Group: *Warming*, *Posting*, *Follow/Unfollow*, *DM*, etc.  
6. **Configure parameters** (delays, randomness, per-device proxies)  
7. **Schedule** Group tasks with staggered start times

> Tip: Start with small batches, validate metrics, then scale group size.

## 🗓️ 4. Scheduling Patterns that Scale

- **Staggered windows**: start groups 5–15 min apart  
- **Rolling waves**: WarmUp → Post → Boost in sequential blocks  
- **Nightly heavy jobs**: posting/cleanup during off-hours  
- **Geo buckets**: separate Groups by region + proxy pool

| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Staggered starts | Reduce spikes & detection | Start 10 devices every 6 min |
| Rolling waves | Multi-step funnels | Warm 2h → Post 1h → Boost 30m |
| Geo split | IP/relevance | `Post-EU`, `Warm-NA`, `Boost-SEA` |

## 🧠 5. Best Practices & Risk Control

- **Human-like randomness**: vary delays, gestures, typing cadence  
- **Per-device proxies**: isolate IPs; avoid shared VPNs/rotators  
- **Limit concurrency**: keep parallel jobs per Group reasonable  
- **Health checks**: watch error rates, dropouts, unusual captchas  
- **Separate risk**: never mix test and main devices in one Group

> **Rule of thumb:** Stable devices + clean proxies + staggered schedules = minimal flags.

---

## 👥 6. Team Collaboration (Without Chaos)

- **Name Groups by owner**: `WarmUp-Alice`, `Post-Bob` for accountability  
- **Shared playbooks**: standard params JSON per task type  
- **Change windows**: only update scripts/versions during agreed slots

---

## 📋 7. Example Blueprint (20 Devices / 120–160 Accounts)

| Group | Devices | Accounts/Device | Task | Schedule |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| WarmUp-A | 8 | 6–8 | Warming script | 09:00–12:00 (staggered) |
| Post-B | 6 | 6–8 | Auto-post + caption | 13:00–16:00 |
| Boost-C | 6 | 6–8 | Follow/Like/Share mix | 17:00–19:00 |

---

## ✅ 8. Checklist

| Category | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Grouping | Split by task/risk/region/team |
| Accounts | ≤ 8 per device; rotate usage |
| Proxies | Per-device residential; monitor reputation |
| Scheduling | Staggered; rolling waves; off-peak heavy jobs |
| Safety | Human-like randomness; health alerts; gradual scale |
