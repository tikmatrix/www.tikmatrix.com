> USB supports **127 devices** per host — *on paper*.  
> In reality, most consumer motherboards hit a wall around **~40 devices** due to chipset/firmware limits and hub topology.

## 🧠 1. The Theory vs. The Reality

- **Spec sheet:** One USB host can address up to **127 devices** (including hubs).  
- **Real world:** Consumer boards often cap out around **30–45 phones** because of:
  - Host controller firmware limits
  - Chipset path congestion (shared lanes)
  - Hub depth/topology constraints (tiers, power)

> Bottom line: The limit is rarely the OS — it’s the **controller + board design**.

## 🖥️ 2. Why Server-Grade Boards Scale Better

Server/workstation boards (e.g., **X79 class**, HEDT platforms) commonly:

- Provide **more root host controllers**
- Have **fewer firmware caps** on device fan-out
- Offer better **lane allocation** and power stability

**Result:** It’s realistically possible to exceed consumer-board ceilings with the same OS and hubs.

## 🔌 3. Practical Wiring Tips (Get More Devices Recognized)

1. **Use rear I/O ports** (direct traces to the motherboard) rather than front-panel headers.  
2. Prefer **USB 2.0 (black)** for large farms; **avoid USB 3.0 (blue)** paths that can be finicky with many MTP/ADB devices.  
3. **BIOS setup:**  
   - **Disable XHCI**  
   - **Enable EHCI**  
   This forces stable USB2 host paths that enumerate big farms more reliably.

> Power matters: use **powered hubs** (quality bricks), short high-quality cables, and spread the load across multiple root controllers.

## 🧩 4. Topology & Power Checklist

| Vector | Recommendation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hub tiers | ≤ 3 tiers deep | Too many cascades = timeouts |
| Hub choice | 7–10 port powered hubs | Separate PSU per hub bank |
| Cable | Short, shielded | Replace flaky leads early |
| Ports | Rear I/O first | Front headers share paths |
| Mix | Keep phones on USB2 paths | Reserve USB3 for storage only |

---

## 🧪 5. Quick Troubleshooting

- **Phones connect/disconnect randomly:** Power budget or bad cable → swap PSU/cable.  
- **New devices stop enumerating at ~38–42:** Controller limit → move hubs to different root ports / add a second controller card / switch to server-grade board.  
- **High CPU during ADB scans:** Too many devices on one controller → rebalance hubs across ports.

## ⚙️ 6. Recommended Config for TikMatrix

- Board: **Server/HEDT** (e.g., X79-class or newer workstation chipsets)  
- Hubs: Multiple **powered USB2 hubs** on different root ports  
- BIOS: **XHCI Off, EHCI On**  
- OS: Standard Windows with ADB drivers; keep WebView/graphics stable for multi-screen

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

Yes, USB can address 127 devices — but consumer boards hit firmware/chipset walls near **~40**.  
Use **rear USB2**, **powered hubs**, and **EHCI-first BIOS** — or go **server-grade** to scale far beyond.
