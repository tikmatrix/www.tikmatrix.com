## 1. Check Your Hashtag Reach

One way to check if you have been shadowbanned by TikTok is to monitor the reach of your hashtags. If your posts are not showing up in the hashtag feeds or search results, it could be an indication that your account has been shadowbanned. Try using different hashtags and see if your posts appear in the search results.

## 2. Monitor Your Engagement

Another way to check for shadowban is to monitor your engagement metrics, such as likes, comments, and shares. If you notice a sudden drop in engagement or if your posts are not getting the usual interactions, it could be a sign that your account has been shadowbanned. Keep an eye on your engagement metrics and compare them to your previous performance.

## 3. Test Your Visibility

To test if your account has been shadowbanned, ask a friend or another TikTok user to search for your account or your posts using specific keywords or hashtags. If they are unable to find your account or posts in the search results, it could indicate that your account has been shadowbanned. Make sure to test your visibility using different devices and accounts to confirm the shadowban.

## 4. Contact TikTok Support

If you suspect that your account has been shadowbanned, you can reach out to TikTok support for assistance. Contact TikTok's support team through the app or website and explain your situation. Provide them with details about your account and the issues you are facing. TikTok's support team will investigate your account and provide you with information on whether you have been shadowbanned.

## 5. Review TikTok's Community Guidelines

Review TikTok's community guidelines and make sure that your content complies with their policies. Violating TikTok's guidelines can lead to shadowban or other restrictions on your account. Make sure to follow TikTok's rules and regulations to avoid being shadowbanned in the future.

By following these steps and monitoring your account's performance, you can check if you have been shadowbanned by TikTok in 2025. If you suspect that your account has been shadowbanned, take the necessary steps to resolve the issue and ensure that your content complies with TikTok's guidelines.
