## 🧭 1) What Is “Post Way”?

**Post Way** is a setting that decides *how TikMatrix navigates to TikTok’s “Create Post” screen* before uploading your media and caption.

TikMatrix supports three post-opening methods:

1. **share** — triggers the system Share flow into TikTok  
2. **add_button** — taps TikTok’s center **+** button on the home screen  
3. **use_sound** — searches a sound name, then taps **Use sound** to launch the composer

---

## ⚙️ 2) The Three Methods at a Glance

| Post Way | How it opens | Pros | Considerations | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `share` | Uses OS share to TikTok | Fast, bypasses some UI changes | Requires correct intent handling on device | Quick single-post flows |
| `add_button` | Taps the home **+** button | Native path, very consistent | Needs the **+** to be visible & account ready | General posting, most accounts |
| `use_sound` | Search → **Use sound** → composer | Great for trend/sound workflows | Needs search access + stable network | Trend posts, multi-device campaigns |

---

## 🧪 3) When to Choose Which

- **Start with `add_button`** for the most “normal user” behavior.  
- **Switch to `share`** if your devices sometimes lag or the **+** button is hidden behind popups.  
- **Use `use_sound`** when your campaign is built around a *specific sound* and you want the composer preloaded with it.

> Tip: On fresh accounts or new installs, do one manual post first to ensure permissions popups are cleared.

---

## 🔧 4) Device/Region Nuances That Matter

- **UI Variants:** TikTok may test different layouts by region/account stage.  
- **Age/Privacy Gates:** Some accounts won’t show the **+** until onboarding is complete.  
- **Search Access:** Corporate networks or strict DNS may block sound search.  
- **RAM/Storage:** Low-memory devices can drop share intents — try `add_button`.

---

## 📋 5) Recommended Defaults & Fallbacks

- Default: **`add_button`**  
- Fallback order if issues arise: **`add_button` → `share` → `use_sound`**  
- For trend tasks: start directly with **`use_sound`** and pin your sound keyphrase.

---

## 🧩 6) Example Workflows

- **Scheduled evergreen posts:** `add_button` → upload → caption → post  
- **Trend hijack:** `use_sound` (“Ocean Eyes Remix”) → record/upload → tag → post  
- **One-off share from gallery:** OS gallery → **Share** → TikTok → finalize

## 🔒 7) Risk Control Checklist (Posting)

| Category | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Behavior | Stagger start times; avoid identical timing across devices |
| Accounts | Warm up with browsing/likes before first posts |
| Network | Per-device residential proxy; avoid shared VPN spikes |
| Media | Optimize size/codec to reduce composer crashes |
| UI | Clear first-run popups manually; ensure microphone/storage permissions |
