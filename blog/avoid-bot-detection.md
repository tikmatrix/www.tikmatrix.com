> Automation should feel **natural**.  
> TikMatrix simulates human behavior so taps, typing, and swipes look like the real thing — not a bot.

## 👆 1. Taps Calculated by AI (No Fixed Coordinates)

Static, pixel-perfect taps scream “automation.”  
TikMatrix uses **AI-calculated touch targets** with micro-randomization:

- **Hitbox awareness:** taps land inside safe areas, not exact centers  
- **Per-device jitter:** variance adapts to resolution/DPI  
- **Context delays:** slight pauses on first paint, layout shifts, or lazy loads

> Principle: same intent, **slightly different** touch each time.

## ⌨️ 2. Typing That Feels Human (No Copy-Paste)

Copy-paste patterns are easy to fingerprint.  
TikMatrix emulates **human typing dynamics**:

- **Burst–pause cadence** (not metronomic)  
- **Occasional tiny corrections** (backspace & retype)  
- **Key-to-key latency curves** reflecting word shape and length

> Text entry times vary with content length, emojis, and punctuation.

## 🌀 3. Inertial, Non-Linear Swipes (Natural Scrolling)

Bots swipe in straight lines at constant speeds. Humans don’t.

- **Curved trajectories** (Bezier-like) with slight hand bias  
- **Inertial profiles**: accelerate → cruise → decelerate  
- **Context-aware stop** near edges, CTAs, or video transitions

> The path and speed envelope change per swipe — like a real thumb.

## 🧩 4. Policy Guardrails (Behavioral Hygiene)

| Vector | Do | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Timing | Randomize within ranges; add view/like/browse mix | Fixed intervals (e.g., every 5s) |
| Sequencing | Vary action order; stagger devices | Synchronous bulk actions |
| Input | Type with cadence; minor edits | Paste walls of text instantly |
| Navigation | Natural dwell times; slight overscroll | Teleport-like jumps, zero dwell |
| Environment | Per-device proxies; locale alignment | Many accounts on one noisy setup |

---

## ⚙️ 5. Suggested Safe Ranges (Starter Profile)

| Action | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tap spacing | 350–900 ms (± jitter) | Longer on first render |
| Type speed | 120–220 ms/char (burst–pause) | Add micro-corrections |
| Swipe length | 380–720 px curved | Vary angle 3–15° |
| Post view | 6–18 s | Mix likes/comments occasionally |

## ✅ 6. Quick Checklist

- Enable **AI taps** (no fixed coordinates)  
- Use **human-like typing** (no instant paste)  
- Turn on **inertial non-linear swipes**  
- Stagger tasks + per-device isolation + natural dwell
