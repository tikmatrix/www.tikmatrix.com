## 🔹 1. New Registration & First Logins → Use **Dynamic Residential** (by traffic)

- **Why:** high-entropy IP rotation reduces linkage across attempts; looks like different households.  
- **Best for:** creating/warming **fresh accounts**.  
- **Tips:** limit concurrency, rotate **per attempt**, align country/locale to target market.

---

## 🔷 2. Long-Term Management → Use **Static Residential** (by quantity)

- **Why:** stable IP builds **trust history** (consistent ASN, rDNS, latency).  
- **Best for:** daily operations on warm/aged accounts.  
- **Tips:** keep **one clean IP per device/account** where possible; avoid sharing across risky profiles.

> 💡 Decide how many devices share the same IP based on risk tolerance. Safer: **1 device : 1 IP**. Moderate: **2–3 devices/IP** with staggered schedules.

## 🧩 3. Quick Comparison

| Factor | Dynamic Residential (Traffic) | Static Residential (Quantity) |
|---|---|---|
| Use case | Registration / first logins | Long-term daily ops |
| Stability | Low–medium (rotates) | **High** (fixed) |
| Linkability | **Low** | Medium (if shared) |
| Risk profile | Good for avoidance early | Best for trust building |
| Cost model | Pay per GB | Pay per IP |

## ⚙️ 4. Operational Guardrails

- **Geo & Locale:** country/region/timezone **match content market**  
- **Rotation Rules:** dynamic → rotate per attempt/session; static → rotate only on incident  
- **Device Isolation:** per-device proxy creds; no shared sessions  
- **Health Checks:** test IP on whoer/ipapi; watch latency & packet loss  
- **Fallback Plan:** keep a small pool of spare static IPs for swaps

---

## ✅ 5. TL;DR Checklist

- Fresh accounts → **Dynamic Residential**  
- Long-term accounts → **Static Residential**  
- Prefer **1 device : 1 IP**; if sharing, stagger & separate behaviors  
- Keep geo consistent; avoid mixing VPNs with residential routes

## 🏁 Conclusion

**Consistency is key to safe growth.** Use dynamic resi to get in cleanly, then switch to static resi to **stay** clean and build trust.
