## 🧠 1. What Is a Shadowban (Operationally)

A shadowban is **suppressed reach** without a formal ban. You still post, but exposure is limited, especially to non-followers and the For You feed.

**Typical signals:**

- Views stall at small, repeatable plateaus (e.g., 100–300)
- Traffic sources skew to “Profile” instead of “For You”
- Fresh posts underperform despite healthy accounts elsewhere

---

## 🛰️ 2. Device & Network Quality (Root Cause #1)

TikTok assesses environment trust. Low-trust setups trigger suppression even with “okay” content.

| Issue | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Recycled cloud phones w/o cleanup | Fast trust decay, unstable IDs | Use **physical Android** or thoroughly sanitized VMs |
| Poor or unstable proxies | Frequent logout, checksum errors | **Residential / clean dedicated** IPs, stable routes |
| Overloaded same environment | Many accounts share device/IP/fingerprint | **Per-device isolation**: proxy, timezone, storage |

> ✅ Cloud phones and proxies can be fine — **if** properly isolated, cleaned, and paired with credible IPs.

---

## 🎬 3. Content Signals (Root Cause #2)

TikTok downranks **low-effort / repetitive / misleading** content and guideline violations.

- **Repetition:** same template, sound, caption patterns
- **Low retention:** viewers drop in first 1–2 seconds
- **Clickbait/misleading:** title–content mismatch
- **Borderline violations:** mature, dangerous, deceptive edits

**Improve by:**

- Hook in first 1–2s, brisk edit rhythm, clear value
- Variation across captions, cuts, music, and canvas
- Respect guidelines; avoid “edgy” farming tactics

## 🧩 4. Quick Environment Checklist (Pre-Posting)

| Category | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Device | Physical Android; avoid second-hand TikTok devices |
| Network | Per-device residential proxies; no shared VPNs |
| Locale | Align region/timezone/language to target market |
| Hygiene | Disable location if inconsistent; uninstall domestic apps |
| Isolation | Separate storage/user profiles; no cross-account leakage |

---

## 🔎 5. Shadowban Diagnostics (Step-by-Step)

1. **A/B account test:** Post the same asset on a known-clean device/IP.  
2. **Source breakdown:** For You vs Profile vs Followers — look for suppression patterns.  
3. **Rotate environment:** New clean proxy + different isolated device.  
4. **Content rewrite:** New hook, edit, caption; remove borderline elements.  
5. **Cooldown window:** 48–72h reduced activity; rebuild “normal” behavior.

---

## 🛠️ 6. Recovery Plan

- **Return to human patterns:** browse → like → short comments → follow (staggered).  
- **Post high-quality, low-risk content** for several days.  
- **Avoid mass edits** (e.g., batch avatar/name changes) across many accounts.  
- **Rebind proxies/devices** if trust looks burned; do not reuse contaminated combos.

> If recovery stalls after 5–7 days, assume environment contamination and **migrate the account** to a clean device + IP pair.

---

## ✅ 7. Risk Control Checklist

| Vector | Do | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Device | Physical phones, clean profiles | Reused cloud phones without reinit |
| Network | Dedicated residential proxies | Shared VPNs / flagged datacenter ranges |
| Behavior | Gradual scaling, randomness | Synchronous bulk actions |
| Content | Originality + retention focus | Repetitive templates / clickbait |
| Ops | Version pin + logs | Constant tinkering mid-campaign |
